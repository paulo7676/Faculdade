 saylor,"MicroStrategy Adopts #Bitcoin as Primary Treasury Reserve Asset. #Bitcoin is the solution.   Everything else is just noise. Satoshi created a city in cyberspace, composed of 21 million city blocks, for the 21st century.  In 2021,  everyone will want a place there.  #Bitcoin I have been chasing after good ideas of  @BarrySilbert  for a decade now.   He generally gets there first, but I am not too proud to copy.  ""Better late than never.""  #Bitcoin #Bitcoin is the first engineered safe-haven asset running on the worlds's first digital monetary network.  As investors lose faith in Gold & Bonds as safe haven assets, it makes sense for all firms to have a Bitcoin strategy.  https://youtu.be/RwSIrTrga_o via  @YouTube Money is flowing out of conventional assets into #Bitcoin due to the escalating risks of global currency devaluation, technology disruption, social dislocation & political uncertainty.  This is not a “rally” or “bubble” – it’s a chain reaction spreading like a fire in cyberspace. Humans prosper by channeling energy. Money is the highest form of energy. Civilization forms on energy networks. #Bitcoin is the most efficient energy network in history. The fallacy of fiat, equity, property, gold, & commodities as stores of value. Replying to  @elonmusk #Bitcoin is an engineered monetary network.  The first of its kind.  A paradigm shift in the history of money.  Everyone needs it, no one can stop it, few understand it.   We are still early. Big Tech will need to integrate their products with #Bitcoin to stay competitive.  All companies will need to convert their treasuries to #BTC to stay solvent. #Bitcoin is a bank in cyberspace, run by incorruptible software, offering a global, affordable, simple, & secure savings account to billions of people that don’t have the option or desire to run their own hedge fund. Connect your phone to the mobile network, your computer to the data network, your home to the power network, & your treasury to the monetary network.  #Bitcoin isn’t just an investment, it’s a way of life. Gradually then suddenly, thoughtful investors will realize that the riskiest decision they can make is to ignore or under-allocate to #Bitcoin.  A decision to invest 1% in #BTC is a decision to underperform, increase risk, or destroy wealth in the other 99% of the portfolio. Crypto exchanges would benefit if they segmented the market & compared the liquidity, volatility, & risk adjusted returns of #BTC to debt, equity, gold, & real estate. To grow by 100x we need to channel money from the asset ocean into the crypto pond.  #Bitcoin is the first engineered monetary network, based on the same principles used to design planes, trains, & automobiles, highways, bridges, & railroads, ports, airports, & cities, telephones, power grids, & the internet. Fix the money, fix the world.  https://youtu.be/YbK6wL9arHw If you don’t fantasize about flaunting it, floating in it, flying in it, frolicking with it, fortifying it, or fighting over it, you should probably play it safe and just buy #Bitcoin. Questioning the intrinsic value of #Bitcoin is about as silly as questioning the intrinsic value of New York City. #Bitcoin is the world’s best treasury reserve asset & the emerging dominant monetary network.  It is the solution to the store of value problem faced by every individual, corporation, & government on earth.  As this news gets out, the world is going to change for the better. Over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, #Bitcoin operated uninterrupted for 113.5 hours vs. 3.5 hours for US capital markets.  Networks from Google, Apple, Facebook, & Amazon also operated uninterrupted.  No one is going to settle for 3.1% availability from their monetary network. The same logic that compels engineers to prefer steel, aluminum, & oxygen for building, flying, & breathing leads me to prefer #Bitcoin for saving. You can struggle to comprehend complicated charts, analyze arbitrary assets, time terrible trades, & prioritize puzzling portfolios, or you can buy #Bitcoin. First we put our communications, advertisements, inquiries, opinions, resumes, relationships, photos, music, & movies on the network.  Now we are going to put our money on the network.  If you missed Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google & Facebook, you might want to catch #Bitcoin. The signal is monetary expansion everywhere.  The problem is people are going to lose half their wealth in a few years.  The solution is #Bitcoin.  The rest is noise. All my best investments were in networks that everyone needed, no one could stop, and few understood.  #Bitcoin is the monetary network. #Bitcoin is the world's best treasury reserve asset, the emerging dominant monetary network, and the solution to the store of value problem faced by 7.5 billion people & $300 trillion in capital.  At this point, it is all but unstoppable. #Gold delivers financial freedom via horse, buggy, & stagecoach.   #Bitcoin is a crypto-powered warp drive.   When the monetary mass transit system of the modern state breaks down, we might go back to an economy powered by horses, donkeys & mules, but I doubt it. The beneficially marriage of Big Tech & #Bitcoin - PayPal gets a reserve asset that has been appreciating more than 100% per year vs. USD for the past decade.   Bitcoin gets a mobile payment network & currency compliance protocols. Investing in #Bitcoin & #Gold because you are looking to store your value is like investing in Apple & Kodak because you are looking to store your photos. @RayDalio   – If #Bitcoin is the solution to the great monetary inflation we all face, you have $ billions to gain.  If it’s not, I have $1 billion in $BTC to lose.   Given the stakes, could you invest an hour & watch my interview below?   We will find the truth together. When the #Bitcoin Dragon emerges from its lair, the first thing it will eat is the Kingdom of #Gold. Banks once offered savings accounts yielding 5% annual interest, taxable.  Today, banks offer 0% interest, or you can choose the Bank of #Bitcoin, offering a savings account currently yielding more than 100% annual interest, tax deferred. #Bitcoin isn’t a train leaving the station, it’s an ark to avoid drowning in the currency flood.   Missing the train means an opportunity lost.   Missing the ark means everything lost. Three things I see:   @Maisie_Williams  is wiser than most professional investors, 45.6% of her fans know the answer, & only .1% of the money has figured this out and moved onto the #Bitcoin monetary network.   #Bitcoin is a risk worth taking.  #Bitcoin is http://hope.com Searching for everlasting value & escape from the sinking Swamp of Fiat, I crossed a Desert of Bonds, wandered the Forest of Stocks, climbed a Mountain of Real Estate & passed the Mirage of Gold, before finally ascending to cyberspace & finding refuge within the Bank of #Bitcoin. What happens to all those Quad 4 trader models when 10 billionaires say ""I bought it.  I am not ashamed of it.  I intend to buy more.""    #Bitcoin is not an information network (GOOG), or a social network (FB).  It's a monetary network. Let that sink in... Augmented by great technology partners, #Bitcoin is capable of collecting all the monetary energy in the world, storing it securely & perpetually without power loss, and channeling it efficiently to anyone or anything at the speed of light.  Few understand this. Today, #BTC was less volatile than NASDAQ, Dow Jones, Russell 2000, 10 & 30 Year Treasuries, Gold, Silver, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet & Facebook & similar to S&P 500.   #Bitcoin advocates can stop apologizing for volatility. I agree with  @APompliano  that it is dangerous to think that Gold & Bitcoin are similar & complementary investments.   When the #Bitcoin Dragon emerges from its lair, the first thing it will eat is the Kingdom of #Gold. @APompliano At the present time, given the state of the digital & macro economy, the #Bitcoin value proposition of ""Store of Value"" is $250 trillion or more, while the value proposition of ""Medium of Exchange"" is ... Nothing.  Less than zero. #Bitcoin is the greatest monetary athlete of our time.   Superstar athletes are exceptional, enigmatic, & erratic in their first decade as they learn & master their craft.   In their second decade, they crush everyone and everything in their path. Technology drives #Bitcoin Adoption.  Cash App generated $1.63 billion of bitcoin revenue during Q3 up approximately 11x year over year.   No one will be building #Gold into their mobile payments app.  It's a pretty, shiny, dumb rock. When I look at #Bitcoin, I don’t see a call option on the future, or apocalypse insurance, or a non-correlated asset class.   I see a new invention – pure monetary energy, and it reminds me of oil, antibiotics, & electricity.  It’s like giving freezing investors the gift of fire. When I look at this chart I see energy flowing one way, into a monetary network, like a battery charging up to power the world.  Every day $BTC trades above the 200WMA #Bitcoin gets stronger, like spinning up a fly wheel.   Does anyone else see what I see? In 1981, Buckminster Fuller predicted a global monetary system based upon uniform energy valuations to solve the problems of economic empowerment we faced then & now from fiat currency.   #Bitcoin is the first true monetary network, based on encrypted energy. #Bitcoin provides Integrity to the digital monetary system.   Liquidity, Scalability, Security, Functionality, Performance, Compatibility, Accessibility, Compliance, & Popularity will be delivered by those individuals, enterprises & agencies that support the Bitcoin Standard. Replying to  @lopp For the first time in history, we have a software network capable of storing & channeling monetary energy without power loss. #Bitcoin is the first digital monetary network.   As investors & enterprises come to realize this, the consequences will be profound. #Google is what happens when we pool information energy on a software network.   Everyone understands this.   #Bitcoin is what happens when we pool monetary energy on a software network.  Few understand this. In theory, the cash flows of a risk-free equity asset would need to grow faster than the rate of monetary expansion for it to serve as a good store of value.  Absent that, the fix would be to either short USD (by leveraging up with debt) or go long #BTC. Imagine a world where everyone used something fair & equitable to settle their economic differences.  #Bitcoin #Facebook is what happens when we pool social energy on a software network.  Everyone understands this.  #Bitcoin is what happens when we pool monetary energy on a software network.  Few understand this. Everyone in the crypto industry would benefit if analysts segmented the market into crypto-assets (e.g. #Bitcoin), crypto-applications (e.g. Ethereum), & crypto-currencies (e.g. Tether), and calculated three different dominance metrics. #Bitcoin is an ark of encrypted energy to escape the currency flood. Tomorrow I am going to try to convince  @KeithMcCullough  to change his opinion of #Bitcoin and join the cyber hornets. #Bitcoin is like Facebook, except no one ever brought a billion friends to #Facebook. #Bitcoin investors understand that preserving energy in a world where everyone else is dissipating it is a winning strategy. The crypto analysts & exchanges should stop comparing #Bitcoin to Altcoins and start comparing Bitcoin to Fiat, Gold, Equity, & Bonds since those assets hold 99.9% of the monetary energy in the world. #Bitcoin will be the dominant monetary network because of the Maximalists.   ""If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry."" #Bitcoin is the first digital monetary system capable of storing all the money in the world for every individual, corporation, and government in a fair & equitable manner, without losing any of it.  If that's not intrinsically valuable, what is? NYDIG parent Stone Ridge holds 10,000+ BTC in its own treasury while managing $10+ billion in other assets for some of the largest corporations, banks & insurers in the world. Firms that sell #Bitcoin should hold #Bitcoin.   #Skininthegame As the trillions of dollars on the balance sheets of banks, asset managers, insurance firms, endowments, & family offices begin their migration to the #Bitcoin universe, they will need firms like NYDIG to guide them.  $1 billion down, more to go. For any company or investor considering #Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset,  @MicroStrategy  has published a curated set of resources including some of the reference materials we relied upon to make our decision. #Bitcoin makes a fine treasury reserve asset.   My admiration goes out to  @jack  and the  @Square  team for leading the way. For 953 million people in 20 countries with weakening currencies, #Bitcoin represents something greater than a treasury asset.  For them, it's more like an ark of encrypted energy to escape the flood. I considered investing our treasury in fiat, bonds, stocks, swaps, index funds, options, real estate, commodities, precious metals, art, & intangibles before settling on #Bitcoin. It seems like the ideal long duration asset – I don’t understand why anyone would want to trade it. 21st century investors lost trillions clinging to 20th century ideas.  #Gold peaked in the 19th century.  Buy #Bitcoin. In this interview I explain why I believe that #Bitcoin is digital gold – the ideal treasury reserve asset.   We discuss inflation, the limitations of physical #gold, & why #Bitcoin has advantages similar to  @Apple ,  @Google , &  @Facebook . In this interview I explain why I believe that #Bitcoin is digital gold - the ideal treasury reserve asset.  We discuss inflation, the limitations of physical #gold, & why #Bitcoin has advantages similar to  @Apple ,  @Google , &  @Facebook .   https://youtu.be/6RuQhsNAYh8 via  @YouTube The magic of #Bitcoin isn’t the transfer of money to someone 10,000 miles away – it is the transfer of money to someone 10,000 days away. No one can buy a pizza with their stock, bonds, real estate, gold, or derivatives.  No one cares.  #Bitcoin does not need to be a medium of exchange. #Bitcoin is 19.3 trillion times more secure than it was 10 years ago, 50x more secure than the next best thing.   Gold is still as secure as it was in 1934.  https://btc.com/stats/diff There is no truth to the stories currently circulating that speculate ""he would not hesitate to dump MicroStrategy’s 38,250 Bitcoin (BTC) at a moment’s notice if an alternative asset’s yields were to jump.""   This is creative journalism. When considering network dominance in the crypto industry, I find it clarifying to separate crypto-asset networks like #Bitcoin from crypto-application networks like Ethereum & stablecoins. Bitcoin dominance has advanced from a low of 71.05% on December 20, 2017 to 93.57% today. To acquire 16,796 BTC (disclosed  9/14/20), we traded continuously 74 hours, executing 88,617 trades ~0.19 BTC each 3 seconds. ~$39,414 in BTC per minute, but at all times we were ready to purchase $30-50 million in a few seconds if we got lucky with a 1-2% downward spike. We acquired 21,454 BTC via 78,388 off-chain transactions, then secured it in cold storage with 18 on-chain transactions.  #Bitcoin scales just fine as a store of value. Each #bitcoin is a block of sunlight encrypted in the key of life. If we agree with  @elerianm  & #WarrenBuffet that bonds are broken as a store of value, then corporate treasury reserve strategies employing bonds no longer work to preserve shareholder value.   #Bitcoin In the 20th century we plugged electricity into our homes.  In the 21st century we plugged electricity into our money.  #Bitcoin In five years a billion people will own #bitcoin. Civilization is based on clean energy, clean water, clean communication, & clean money.   #Bitcoin provides corporations protection against currency devaluation as well as an option to participate in the explosive growth of the digital monetary network. “It is better to have a permanent income than to be fascinating.” - Oscar Wilde on #Bitcoin MicroStrategy has purchased an additional ~19,452 bitcoins for ~$1.026 billion in cash at an average price of ~$52,765 per #bitcoin. As of 2/24/2021, we #hodl ~90,531 bitcoins acquired for ~$2.171 billion at an average price of ~$23,985 per bitcoin. $MSTR “Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves.” – Peter Lynch on #Bitcoin In 2020, more than three million customers purchased or sold bitcoin on $SQ Cash App, and, in January 2021, more than one million customers purchased #bitcoin for the first time. Cash App generated $1.76 billion of bitcoin revenue during Q4 of 2020, up approximately 10x YoY. #Bitcoin is for saving, not for spending.   @RussellOkung  and I agree on this point & would like to respectfully submit to @JanetYellen that the primary use case of bitcoin is to preserve the life savings of the people so they can achieve their hopes & aspirations. If you focus on the networks that provide our modern world with hygienic water, clean electricity, & clear communications it becomes obvious why we need a digital monetary network.   #Bitcoin “Wide diversification is only required when investors do not understand what they are doing.” - Warren Buffett on #Bitcoin “Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.” - Archimedes on #Bitcoin My latest discussion with  @saifedean  covering the Fiat Standard & the migration of the store of value function from Gold to Bonds to Equity to Bitcoin.  Gold is antiquated & elitist, #Bitcoin is egalitarian, progressive, & the expanding molten crypto core of the monetary planet. “The successful warrior is the average man, with laser-like focus.” - Bruce Lee on #Bitcoin “If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.” ~ Nikola Tesla on #Bitcoin MicroStrategy Completes $1.05 Billion Offering of Convertible Notes at 0% Coupon and 50% Conversion Premium with #Bitcoin Use of Funds Gold peaked in August 2020 at the same time  @MicroStrategy  chose #Bitcoin as the superior asset. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to understand #bitcoin. February 8, 2021 was an inflection point for #Bitcoin and mainstream adoption is going to accelerate as the ever more compelling logic of a digital monetary network spreads around the globe. For the first time in history we can own property in cyberspace.  The greatest city of the 21st century will be built upon 21 million blocks of #bitcoin. “If life were predictable it would cease to be life, and be without flavor.” - Eleanor Roosevelt on #Bitcoin ""You are my heart, my life, my one and only thought."" - Arthur Conan Doyle on #Bitcoin “Never f- with a winning streak.” - Crash Davis on #Bitcoin “The secret to success is to know something nobody else knows.” - Aristotle Onassis on #Bitcoin “No force on earth can stop an idea whose time has come.” - Victor Hugo on #Bitcoin “The pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity.  The optimist sees opportunity in every difficulty.” - Winston Churchill on #Bitcoin Last week at  @MicroStrategy  Bitcoin for Corporations conference, I presented my views on corporate #bitcoin strategies to preserve capital, generate income, and create shareholder value. If institutions want to move billion dollar blocks of money around the globe, gold is a million times more expensive than #bitcoin, and a thousand times slower.   We can’t build a modern economy on antiquated technology. #Bitcoin moves pretty fast.  If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it. #Bitcoin is engineered to convert your balance sheet from a liability to an asset. It’s a million times better than gold, it moves at the speed of light, more than 100 million people are using it now & approaching 1 billion users in five years, with millennials leading the way. My latest thoughts on monetary engineering, the #bitcoin network, longevity of protocols, folly of commodity money like gold, silver, & glass beads, brand strength & why Buffett should love Bitcoin, decentralized mining dynamics, macro investment strategy. Companies that repurchase their stock with cash weaken their business.  Those that buyback stock with debt actually impoverish their business.  #Bitcoin on the balance sheet is a rational alternative that strengthens a capital structure to the benefit of all stakeholders. As corporations adopt #bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset on their balance sheets, they replace a non-performing asset with the best performing asset, choosing volatile appreciation over stable depreciation.  This Bitcoin Strategy benefits all shareholders over the long term. Tesla $TSLA has de-risked the acquisition of #bitcoin by public companies and accelerated the digital transformation of corporate balance sheets.  Treasurers are now thinking about how to convert a non-performing asset into the best performing asset. Congratulations & thank you to  @elonmusk  &  @Tesla  on adding #Bitcoin  to their balance sheet.  The entire world will benefit from this leadership. I dream of cities in cyberspace built on blocks of #bitcoin. Our  @MicroStrategy  World 2021 was a great success, with 22,031 registrants. The #Bitcoin for Corporations program attracted 8,197 attendees from 6,917 different enterprises. All sessions are free & uploaded here, along with our Bitcoin Corporate Playbook. For billions of people, #Bitcoin represents hope. 24 hours. 360 degrees. 100 percent. 21 million #bitcoin. Today we will be interviewing 10 of the most influential leaders in the #Bitcoin marketplace live.  Yesterday I was shocked by  @NYDIG  Ross Stevens' estimate of $25 billion in institutional $BTC assets by year end.  Now I am wondering if anyone might beat that? Join us & find out. We had a surge of late registrations yesterday that maxed out our online event service provider for awhile. 20,653 official registered for #WorldNow with 5656 joining our #Bitcoin for Corporations track. If you missed it, session videos are uploaded now: With all due respect, #Bitcoin is not a currency and it is not replacing the dollar.  It is a monetary asset rapidly replacing Gold as a store of value.  It will coexist with fiat currencies as it attracts capital from weaker safe haven assets.  Let's discuss -  @SteveForbesCEO My formula for success is rise early, work late, and buy #bitcoin. I have never seen so many CEOs sign up to attend one of our events.  Send yours, or come join our sessions & report back to your team.  Every company can benefit from plugging into the #Bitcoin Monetary Network. #Bitcoin is for Closers! #Bitcoin is designed to transfer money from the Active to the Patient. #Bitcoin is the signal and it's getting louder. “Going forward, we continue to plan to hold our bitcoin and invest additional excess cash flows in bitcoin. Additionally, we will explore various approaches to acquire additional bitcoin as part of our overall corporate strategy.” #Bitcoin is a bank in cyberspace.   Deposit the amount of money you wish to keep. We are going to open source our #Bitcoin Corporate Playbook, an array of documents covering governance, legal, financial, technical & accounting considerations.  Get the briefing & early access at our Bitcoin for Corporations conference Feb 3/4.  http://ow.ly/D8De50DkaUB #Bitcoin wasn't built in a day. Today, I had a good discussion with  @MorganLBrennan  &  @GuyAdami  about the maturation of #Bitcoin as an asset class, the acceleration of #BTC adoption by institutions, & the advantages corporations are gaining as they join the #Bitcoin monetary network. I discuss the emergence of the #Bitcoin Standard, the risks of diversification, the non-threat of regulation, the inevitability of monetary technology, the arrival of corporations, & the increase of Bitcoin's monetary force. Food -> Fridge Content -> Cloud  Bullion -> #Bitcoin Humanity advances by engineering - civil, chemical, biomedical, metallurgical, mechanical, nautical, electrical, aeronautical, astronautical & now monetary.  #Bitcoin Like #Bitcoin, living things are volatile.   Dead things, not so much. Rumor and speculation about stable coins, alt coins, exchanges, & CBDCs are irrelevant to rational investors holding #Bitcoin as a store of value. #Bitcoin is thermal armor to replace your paper vest.  Winter is coming. #Bitcoin is money.  Everything else is credit. Powering your treasury with #Bitcoin is like powering your home with #Electricity. #Bitcoin is an open, fair, & equitable monetary network.  It improves as new members contribute their human & financial capital, just like every country, state, city, agency, company, club, church, party, union, cooperative, association, school, institution, ideology, & culture. Looking forward to meeting up with  @Scaramucci  for Round 2 on Thursday.   I intend to tell him to sell his gold, mortgage his house, and buy more #Bitcoin. My recent thoughts on #Bitcoin as money, the demise of Gold, de-monetizing defective assets, price discovery, hyperinflation, regulatory concerns & criticisms, debt financing, crypto theory, & Newtonian network dynamics shared with 200,000 cyber hornets. ""I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence:  Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.""  #Bitcoin, not Gold. #Bitcoin is the solution.  Everything else is noise. Everyone needs a #Bitcoin Strategy.  https://youtu.be/OY50vle8QSA #Bitcoin is a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth, exponentially growing ever smarter, faster, and stronger behind a wall of encrypted energy. ""Warren Buffett famously called bitcoin “rat poison.” He may well be right. #Bitcoin could be rat poison, and the rat could be cash."" -Bill Miller, CFA #Bitcoin is the first store of value in the world where supply is entirely unaffected by increased demand.   @Scaramucci #Bitcoin Theory, Medium of Exchange, Transactions & Treasury, Tax, Optionality, Crypto Theory, Market Segments, SoV vs MoE vs UoM, Immortal Sovereignty, Morality, Endowments, Magic Power, Digital & Crypto Integration, Rockefeller, Cyber Immortality On the 1st business day of 2021, #Bitcoin takes its rightful place atop the Financial Times.   “No force on earth can stop an idea whose time has come”― Victor Hugo If you wish to leave the world a better place, you need to leave the money to pay for it.  #Bitcoin #Gold doesn't work anymore.   #Bitcoin broke it. Computers made people smarter.  Automobiles made people faster.  Electricity made people stronger.  #Bitcoin is making people wealthier. Once you decide #Bitcoin is an asset class, if you are not long, you are short. “Eureka! I have found it!” - Archimedes on #Bitcoin Gold being demonetized, replaced by #Bitcoin, one app at time.  ""Bitcoin, as the flagship cryptocurrency, has grown tremendously as an asset over the last decade, earning wider acceptance among Fortune 500 companies, institutional financial firms, and individual investors alike."" ""Inflation was 36.1%, which was at least lower than the 53.8% of 2019.  Inflation is expected to reach 48% this year.""   Argentina has a population of 45 million, and for each one of them, #Bitcoin has become a moral imperative. When you grasp the magnitude of the misery inflicted on the multitude by monetary collapse, the moral imperative of #Bitcoin becomes clear. “Following the light of the sun, we left the old world.” - Christopher Columbus on #Bitcoin   ( @WorldofRusty ) #Bitcoin grew to a trillion dollar network faster than anything humanity has yet to devise because it is the most elegant & efficient technology for converting energy into prosperity. “Upon the subject of education, not presuming to dictate any plan or system respecting it, I can only say that I view it as the most important subject which we as a people can be engaged in.” - Abraham Lincoln on #Bitcoin Considering creating a new free online course “Blockclock for Everybody” to help new members of the rapidly expanding #Bitcoin community get up to speed. “We have it in our power to begin the world over again."" - Thomas Paine on #Bitcoin “We fear things in proportion to our ignorance of them.” - Titus Livius (Livy) on #Bitcoin #Bitcoin is an orange star burning with a trillion dollars of energy in cyberspace, making it the most stable monetary body in our economic universe. “The first step towards getting somewhere is to decide that you are not going to stay where you are.” - J.P. Morgan on #Bitcoin CPI is a misleading measure of inflation.  Volatility is a misleading measure of risk.   The former distracts us from the problem, while the later distracts us from the solution.  #Bitcoin It is rational for publicly traded #Bitcoin miners to become net purchasers of BTC rather than sellers. “The computer can be used as a tool to liberate and protect people, rather than to control them.” - Hal Finney on #Bitcoin “Forget mistakes. Forget failure. Forget everything except what you're going to do now and do it. Today is your lucky day.” - Will Durant on #Bitcoin #Bitcoin is an idea whose time has come. “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.” - Upton Sinclair on #Bitcoin As long as time flies and water falls, capital will flow from weak assets to strong.  #Bitcoin “Truth is ever to be found in the simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things.” - Isaac Newton on #Bitcoin #Bitcoin runs on stranded energy at the edge of the grid and acts as a global battery for otherwise idle generation facilities. It recycles wasted energy, mitigates capital destruction, & provides a mechanism to commercialize clean, renewable energy wherever we may find it. In 2019, American Airlines spent $9.395 billion on fuel to generate $3.065 billion in operating income.  Energy intensity is 306% vs. 1% for #Bitcoin.  The primary use of BTC energy is to protect $1 trillion+ network assets, not process transactions.  https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-uses-more-energy-than-american-airlines-bank-of-america-2021-3-1030224439… Macroeconomics trumps microeconomics.  Strategy defeats tactics.  “If you wouldn’t hold it for 10 years, you probably shouldn’t hold it for 10 minutes.”  Ignore the noise, #Bitcoin is the signal.  #HODL Since #Bitcoin runs on stranded energy at the edge of the grid and acts as a global battery for otherwise idle generation facilities, it recycles wasted energy, mitigates capital destruction, & provides a mechanism to commercialize clean, renewable energy wherever we may find it. 99.97% of the world’s energy (in USD) is devoted to powering a mixture of technologies with an energy intensity of ~10% while the remaining 0.03% powers the Bitcoin network with an energy intensity of ~1%.  #Bitcoin is environmentally friendly & technically efficient.

The second rule of Bitcoin is: You do not sell your bitcoin.” - Tyler Durden on #Bitcoin The Lord of Light isn’t done with you yet. #Bitcoin #Bitcoin is hope for Nuclear Power. Replying to  @neelkashkari Nothing has created more wealth in the past decade than technologies banned in China. #Bitcoin #Bitcoin on #Lightning is the future of global payments. Nature abhors a fair fight. #Bitcoin First #Bitcoin, then #Lightning. It's only a matter of time. All of these regulatory developments are good for Bitcoin. Volatility will decrease, public confidence will increase, and institutional and retail adoption of Bitcoin will accelerate as clarity & compliance comes to the digital asset space. #Bitcoin In this session with  @Breedlove22  we discuss why the Bitcoin Standard is superior to the Gold Standard or Fiat Standard, as well as the technical reasons #Bitcoin is critical to cybersecurity and the cyber economy of the 21st century. Every company on Earth is sitting on a balance sheet that is normally cash and credit. Cash and credit are crumbling. I discuss how #Bitcoin solves this problem in my interview with @Alex_fights of  @BitcoinMagazine . If you believe in #Bitcoin and wish to do something to help thousands of companies fix their balance sheets, please go to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) website and post your support for the adoption of Fair Value accounting. Comments are due by Wednesday. Once you realize that #Bitcoin is digital property, or digital money, or digital energy, it becomes clear that everything else you could possibly own is inferior. You would really never want to own anything other than pure digital energy. The winners are monetary technology, energy technology, computer technology, entertainment technology, retail technology, software technology, mobile technology, and information technology. The losers are antiquated technology, fiat credit, and a box of rocks. #Bitcoin Every week I report & have removed 50-100 malicious imposter accounts from Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, + fake Web Domains attempting to scam innocents by offering free bitcoin, crypto, trading advice or services while imitating me or my firm. Be careful.  When you move faster than the speed of sound, you generate shock waves. #Bitcoin “If fortune favors you do not be elated; if she frowns do not despond.” - Ausonius on #Bitcoin If you have a #Bitcoin or #Crypto business strategy, then the highest return, lowest risk, most rational behavior is to adopt #bitcoin as your treasury reserve asset. #Gold is down 10.5% in the same year #Bitcoin is up 332%. Gold has returned 0% per year in the same decade Bitcoin has returned 146% annually. Why do we still debate which is the superior store of value? My interview with  @emilychangtv  on  @BloombergTV  tonight covered $MSTR tripling down on #Bitcoin as well as my thoughts on regulation, the significance of El Salvador, and the role of Bitcoin as an institutional grade digital asset. #Bitcoin mining converts electrical energy into digital energy. In time, the world will view the production of digital energy for export no differently than the production of aluminum, steel, oil, or petrochemicals. #Bitcoin is the (de)central bank of cyberspace. Mechanical. Kinetic. Wind. Chemical. Hydro. Thermal. Solar. Nuclear. Electrical. Digital. #Bitcoin “There is no instance of a nation benefitting from prolonged warfare.” - Sun Tzu on #Bitcoin Replying to  @GravelInstitute This policy deprives foreigners of their property rights and impairs the value of all residential property in Canada, thereby destroying wealth. This is why investors need to replace real property with digital property. #Bitcoin is hope for #Canada. Replying to  @JustinTrudeau #Bitcoin miners are making Bitcoin stronger as they raise capital, recruit talent, build facilities, upgrade technology, join communities, support the local economy, secure the network, mine bitcoin, and #hodl it on their balance sheets. Replying to  @jordanbpeterson Study why #Gold fails to understand why #Bitcoin succeeds. Replying to  @SenWarren Replying to  @StephenCurry30 On September 7, El Salvador will officially begin using #Bitcoin as its national currency alongside the U.S. dollar. Every cyber hornet  I know is planning to buy $30 in BTC tomorrow in solidarity with the people of #ElSalvador and their leader  @nayibbukele . Will you join us? If I had chosen #Gold instead of #Bitcoin last year, it would have been a multi-billion dollar mistake. It doesn't help to diagnose the problem if you don't choose the right solution. #Bitcoin is the dominant digital monetary network and an opportunity for everyone. #Bitcoin is technology to transfer energy through time and space.  Diamonds may be your best friend, but #Bitcoin is forever. Replying to  @elonmusk Engineer a better tomorrow. #Bitcoin Please join the  @MicroStrategy  management team at 5pm ET as we discuss our Q3 2021 results and answer questions about our business results and outlook for #BusinessIntelligence and #Bitcoin. $MSTR You do not need to sell your #bitcoin. You do not sell your #bitcoin. Money is half of everything. #Bitcoin In “How #Bitcoin Changes Everything”  @Breedlove22  and I discuss scaling via applications like currency, banking, corporate securities, ETFs, bonds, funds, hardware, clouds, browsers, social networks, cyber security, ecommerce, payments, & orange checks. The U.S. took an economic lead in the 19th century with chemical energy, then furthered that lead in the 20th century with electrical energy. Economic prosperity in the 21st century will come from digital energy. #Bitcoin When large U.S. banks are able to hold #bitcoin on their balance sheets, everyone will want to buy it, no one will need to sell it, and you won't be able to afford it. “A thought, even a possibility, can shatter and transform us.” - Nietzsche on #Bitcoin Replying to  @elonmusk  and  @CathieDWood Stablecoin regulatory clarity will accelerate the adoption of #BTC as the world reserve digital asset (store of value) and USD as the world reserve digital currency (medium of exchange). Wall Street thinks plugging your business into #Bitcoin is a good idea. $BKKT If you do your homework, you won't flunk #Bitcoin. Replying to  @elonmusk  @Filasophical  and  @ShibaInuHodler Do not sell me your #bitcoin. There are approximately 218,000 financial advisers in the United States managing assets in excess of $110 trillion, and as of this week they can allocate client assets to #Bitcoin via ETFs which integrate with their business model & information systems. Replying to  @jack It doesn’t have to be perfect, just good enough to last forever. #Bitcoin #Bitcoin is hope for Corporations. To be rid of risks, you need to take one. #Bitcoin My fun, wide ranging discussion with  @invest_answers  on the institutional adoption of #bitcoin, benefits of volatility, ETFs & arbitrage, investment strategy, bitcoin mining, charity, education, statistics, & a whale named Saylor.  #Gold was the monetary index of the 19th century until it was replaced by an array of regional stock indexes in the 20th century. #Bitcoin will be the primary monetary index of the 21st century. In “Bitcoin Economics & Evolution”  @Breedlove22  and I discuss the competitive dynamics of #Bitcoin mining & impact of protocol, semiconductors, engineering, & capital markets on security & integrity, + layered scaling of financial & technical applications. #Bitcoin is up 440% on the one year anniversary of my conversation with  @KeithMcCullough . BTC is not a commodity to be traded, it is a monetary scarcity, technology, & protocol and it should be owned. Replying to  @cz_binance Replying to  @cz_binance The halls of eternity echo with the cries of those who sold their #bitcoin. #Bitcoin is for you. Our BMC survey this quarter showed dramatic improvements in #Bitcoin mining energy efficiency & sustainability. Join us today at 5pm EDT for a live briefing with industry updates from a panel of bitcoin mining CEOs, accompanied by an analyst Q&A session. #Bitcoin mining is a disruptive dance of technology, capital, engineering, and energy. $RIOT and #Texas lead the way with sustainable energy, flexible power grids, and industrial scale immersion-cooled mining operations. Your money won’t last forever, unless it’s #bitcoin. #Bitcoin represents an enormous strategic opportunity for Americans and the United States as a whole...and can help America maintain its economic leadership for decades to come.  @Avik This is a golden reminder to think for yourself. #Bitcoin My conversation with  @Firas_Zahabi  on #Bitcoin, inflation, bleeding, MMA, athletic performance, property rights, energy systems, winning, digital property & energy, merits of competition, & the future. BJJ is Proof of Work and the Bitcoin of Martial Arts. If you wait until everyone understands it, you won't be able to afford it. #Bitcoin #Bitcoin is the Kingmaker. Join us Tuesday October 19 at 5pm EDT for our Q3 briefing on the State of the #Bitcoin Mining Industry, with an update on hash rate, energy, efficiency, & sustainability metrics, along with briefings from a panel of BTC mining CEOs as well as Analyst Q&A. https://youtu.be/JPai5uoN2tg Save yourself. #Bitcoin Satoshi started a fire in cyberspace. #Bitcoin Thank God for #Bitcoin #Bitcoin grows stronger each time a miner goes public. #Bitcoin is now Made In America. My handle has changed to  @saylor , but the song remains the same. #Bitcoin The critical question faced by bankers and investors worldwide is “Do you understand #Bitcoin?” #Bitcoin is a bank in cyberspace run by incorruptible software. #Bitcoin is the most disruptive technology of the decade. My comprehensive discussion of monetary dynamics including property, energy, technology, competition, capital, politics, & applications with  @mcshane_writes  of  @BitcoinMagazine . Only invest what you can’t afford to lose. #Bitcoin There is no second best. #Bitcoin The implicit endorsement of Bitcoin by major banks and regulators is going to accelerate the collapse of #Gold and the rise of #Bitcoin as the preferred safe-haven store of value for both institutional and retail investors. There is no end to up. #Bitcoin Replying to  @PeterSchiff  @novogratz  and  @CNBC In ""Bitcoin Seven Layers of Security #1”  @Breedlove22  and I discuss how #Bitcoin mining provides asset security, integrity, & durability via energy, technology, & politics while decentralizing the network, stabilizing governments, and spreading prosperity. #Bitcoin is breaking out from other cryptos due to regulatory expectations, making it the clear choice for institutional investors seeking digital property as a store of value. Replying to  @jack  and  @cz_binance You may not be interested in #Bitcoin, but Bitcoin is interested in you. In retrospect, it was inevitable that banks would embrace #bitcoin. Fair value accounting for #Bitcoin will facilitate institutional adoption of the asset class and benefit the entire economy. On October 1, 2021,  @MarathonDH  obtained a $100 million revolving line of credit, secured by #bitcoin and USD, with Silvergate Bank. We now have a publicly traded Bitcoin miner borrowing against their BTC to purchase mining equipment. $MARA #Bitcoin is #Bitcoin mining upgrades thermal energy into digital energy that can be exported anywhere in the world and stored without power loss. In the presence of rampant inflation, cash & credit become crumbling liabilities. Convert your balance sheet to #bitcoin to turn liabilities into assets. Do the right thing. #Bitcoin Public Service Announcement: Every hour my team reports 10-15 scammer YouTube videos impersonating me or  @MicroStrategy  that offer free bitcoin rewards. They pop up as fast as we can have them removed.   Only trade #bitcoin on a legitimate exchange you trust. Everyone has double-digit inflation if they measure it correctly and needs #Bitcoin more than they realize. Regardless of whether you are a pessimist or optimist, the answer is still #Bitcoin. #Bitcoin offers better inflation protection than #Gold and is growing faster than #BigTech. Em resposta a  @ggreenwald  e  @CitizenBitcoin Checklist for a currency crisis: Convert weak currency (TRY) to strong currency (USD). Convert analog currency to digital currency (Stablecoin). Convert analog property to digital property (#BTC). Take custody of your digital currency & digital property. Em resposta a  @elonmusk As #Bitcoin miners come public via the US capital markets they create a bridge between the traditional assets of the past and the digital assets of the future, accelerating institutional adoption of BTC as Digital Property. Congrats  @PeterGWall  and $ARBK.

If you want to survive, convert your working capital from TRY to USD. If you want to thrive, convert all your capital from TRY to #BTC. Life finds a way. #Bitcoin Everyday another superstar joins Team #Bitcoin. Just #Bitcoin. We need to educate 9 in 10 Americans about #Bitcoin. ""If we are living in a simulation, Bitcoin will crash it."" -  @dergigi  on #Bitcoin The non-stop parade of #Bitcoin miners coming public is accelerating the adoption of BTC as an institutional reserve asset while rapidly upgrading the technical and political security of the network & attracting billions of dollars in permanent capital.  #Bitcoin is hope for #Turkey. The currency has lost a third of its value since March and declined for nine consecutive years. Conversion from TRY to USD will merely slow the collapse, while adoption of BTC will reverse the damage & revitalize the economy. Em resposta a  @tferriss Enjoy the ride. #Bitcoin You do not sell the family #bitcoin. A publicly traded #Bitcoin miner  @MarathonDH  is raising $500 million in a debt offering to acquire bitcoin and bitcoin mining machines. This is not factored into anyone's model. $MARA Just make sure you don't run out of money. #Bitcoin Em resposta a  @cz_binance #Inflation is the problem. #Bitcoin is the solution.

In my interview this morning with  @MorganLBrennan  &  @davidfaber  on  @SquawkStreet  I noted that #Bitcoin is the only crypto-asset that passes the  @MicroStrategy  test.

 APompliano,"I want everyone to learn about Bitcoin.  To move us closer to that reality, I’m giving out 5 free subscriptions to the daily letter I write to 40,000 investors.  Retweet this tweet and subscribe at this link to be considered for the free subscription: http://offthechain.substack.com This week in crypto:  1.  @binance  launches B2B2C cloud platform 2. Fidelity invests $14M in BC Group 3. Swedish central bank testing e-krona 4. Shopify joins Libra Association 5. @unstoppabledomains launches browser 6. Bitcoin is still not dead :)  More building each week! The Bitcoin halving is not priced in. ""In a world where central bankers are tripping over themselves to devalue their currency, Bitcoin wins. In a world of fiat currencies, Bitcoin is the victor.""  Bitcoin just hit $10,000.  I still think that Bitcoin will hit $100,000 by end of December 2021.  Fixed supply. Increasing demand. Time will tell.   #Bitcoin 21,000,000 total Bitcoin available.  That’s it.  As demand rises, the value of each goes up.  So simple, yet most people try to make it more complex than it really is.  Don’t try to outsmart supply and demand economics  Bitcoin has broken the 500 million transaction milestone just over 11 years after launch.  Crazy. Bitcoin doesn’t care about your opinion. #Bitcoin   Finally it has arrived  This may be one of the most ambitious projects in all of Bitcoin. @JackMallers  and the Zap team just announced  @ln_strike !   The fastest, cheapest way to send any currency around the world.  I want everyone to learn about Bitcoin.  Because of that, I’m giving away 3 free subscriptions to the newsletter I write to institutional investors about the industry every morning.  Retweet this tweet and I’ll select 3 people. Knowledge is power! This week in crypto:  1. Bitcoin hashrate hits all-time high 2. Gemini launch insurance product 3. Digital Dollar Foundation launched 4. Grayscale reports record 2019  5. Binance US launches new apps 6. Bitcoin still not dead :)  Onwards! Important message as we enter the next Bitcoin bull market:  - BTC is very volatile - You can lose all of your money - Only invest what is ok to lose - Twitter is not investment advice - Don't buy BTC with credit cards - Keep low time preference - Do your own research In 2012, it took 1/10th of an ounce of gold to buy 1 Bitcoin.  In 2019, it took 6 ounces of gold to buy 1 Bitcoin.  It looks like one is becoming more valuable than the other.  What say you  @PeterSchiff ?!  Dear Central Bankers,  Here is a free idea.  Print more of the currency backed by air and buy Bitcoin, which is backed by math. Important message ~ 5 months before the Bitcoin halving:  - BTC is very volatile - You can lose all of your money - Only invest what is ok to lose - Twitter is not investment advice - Don't buy BTC with credit cards - Keep low time preference - Do your own research The Bitcoin network was launched 11 years ago today.  It has quickly become a dominant force in global finance.  Happy Birthday, Bitcoin  Long Bitcoin, Short the Bankers! While the Federal Reserve is engaging in enormous quantitative easing, Bitcoin just went through the third quantitative hardening event in history.   Proceed accordingly. Yo  @PeterSchiff , Bitcoin has a lower inflation rate than gold now.  Just saying. “The digitization of the world clearly benefits bitcoin”   An absolute legend of Wall Street is going to push hundreds of thousands of people who watch  @SquawkCNBC  to go educate themselves on Bitcoin. Still hilarious that oil went to $0 and Bitcoin didn’t. We are in an economic crisis and Bitcoin is drastically outperforming every asset.  It is literally serving as the strongest safe haven.  The people are waking up to the game.  They are choosing to protect themselves.   Even Paul Tudor Jones is a Bitcoiner now. Important message as we enter the next Bitcoin bull market:  - BTC is very volatile - You can lose all of your money - Only invest what is ok to lose - Twitter is not investment advice - Don't buy BTC with credit cards - Keep low time preference - Do your own research Bang Bang .... Paul Tudor Jones buys Bitcoin.  Welcome the the party  Warren Buffett has $137 billion in cash.  That is almost enough to buy every Bitcoin in the circulating supply. Bitcoin shook out the weak hands of Wall Street right before the halving.  You couldn’t write a better script  Coinbase has crashed as Bitcoin skyrockets today. S&P 500 YTD:  -23% DJIA YTD:  -16% Bitcoin: YTD:  +11%  Show this to your financial advisor and ask them why they keep ignoring the best performing asset of the last decade. If this video is real, it highlights just how well understood Bitcoin is by the world’s most powerful people.  The next reserve currency won’t be controlled by a nation state. The Fed's $6 trillion stimulus plan would be enough to buy the entire market cap of Bitcoin more than 48 times. Wall Street will hate it, but nobody has been more right about the macro economy than Gold and Bitcoin investors.  They have been calling for these insane levels of QE for awhile.  Was just a matter of time. 12 month performance of assets:  S&P: - 14% DJIA: - 21% Gold: + 25% Bitcoin: + 69%  Educate yourself. Wall Street ain't looking out for you! The government wants to give stimulus money to Americans through a digital dollar.  This will onboard hundreds of millions of people to Bitcoin. THEY ARE LITERALLY CUTTING RATES AND PRINTING MONEY RIGHT INTO THE BITCOIN HALVING.  Unbelievable. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin just said the Federal Reserve and Treasury are working to provide “unlimited liquidity” to the financial system.  UNLIMITED LIQUIDITY.  This is going to be the greatest monetary stimulus experiment in history.  Bitcoin was built for this. RUMOR: The Bitcoin CEO has sent a company wide email to all employees to work from home for the rest of the year. Summary of today:  S&P 500 down 7.8% Dow Jones down 7.7% Bitcoin down 5.8%  The stock market was more volatile than Bitcoin.   Stock investors aren't used to this.  Bitcoiners are unfazed by the volatility. Someone tell the Bitcoin detractors that oil just dropped more in a single day than Bitcoin ever has.  Too much volatility!  Scarcity is probably the most important rule in economics.  Many things are scarce — raw materials, precious metals, etc.  Only one asset is PROVABLY scarce though.  It also happens to be fully decentralized & not controlled by any person or group.  Bitcoin is ultimate scarcity. Another company converts their balance sheet capital to Bitcoin.  Gradually, then suddenly  Square started testing Bitcoin purchases in Cash App back in November 2017.  The company's stock is up more than 300% since then.  Last quarter, Cash App generated $875 million of bitcoin revenue and $17 million of bitcoin gross profit.  It pays to embrace Bitcoin. MicroStrategy Inc. is a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ.  Valuation: $1.39 billion 2019 revenue: $486 million # of employees: 2,396  Stock closed today at $143.84 which is about 15% higher than a week ago when they decided to put $250M in balance sheet capital into Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s market cap will surpass gold’s market cap by Dec 31, 2029.  Posting this as a receipt for the future. Everyone laughed when I said gold had infinite supply.  Now people are starting to realize how accurate it was.  Bitcoin’s value is driven by PROVABLE scarcity.  The world has shifted from valuing narratives to valuing truth. Bitcoin doesn’t care who the President is [NEW POST] A Public Company Just Converted Their Balance Sheet Cash To Bitcoin As Their Reserve Asset  ""Bitcoin is digital gold – harder, stronger, faster, and smarter than any money that has preceded it."" Bitcoin is the most ruthless asset in the world.  Hits $12,000 and then drops $1,500 in minutes.  Not for the faint of heart. I think Bitcoin is up big today because  @PeterSchiff  went and bought a bunch after our livestream last night. #Bitcoin smashing through $11,000 like the king that it is Bitcoin is currently up more than 50% in 2020.  Crypto continues to be the best performing asset class in this economic recession.  Every investor needs to get off zero. The OCC decision on Bitcoin happened because a Bitcoiner took over the leadership of the organization.  Don't underestimate the change that a single Bitcoiner can drive inside these legacy institutions. Bitcoin let’s you be the bank. Nobody knows if the Federal Reserve is going to print more dollars next week, next month, or later this year.  We know exactly what Bitcoin will be doing though.   Proceed accordingly. They’re not making more land and they’re not making more Bitcoin. I’m calling it now. On July 1, 2020  @billburr  and  @bertkreischer  kicked off a historic 18 month Bitcoin bull market  Wall Street hates Bitcoin because they worship the Federal Reserve.  They can’t believe that an algorithm can do monetary policy better than a bunch of old white dudes in suits and ties. 2020 Year-to-date Performance Summary  S&P:  1% NASDAQ:  2% GOLD:  11% BITCOIN:  35%  Bitcoin has been the best performing asset during the recent crisis. It did exactly what it was supposed to do. What an incredible year it has been for Bitcoin. Enjoy this highlight video from my team  Bitcoin’s market cap is officially higher than Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Can we get $30k bitcoin to end the year?!  Bitcoin just hit another all-time high  Bitcoin and Tesla have been two of the best investments in recent years.  - Both became a meme - Communities are fanatical - Highly disruptive to incumbents - Obvious to young people - Incredibly anti-fragile - Market expanding tech - Multi-decade plays  Innovation drives returns Retweet this if you would move to Miami if Mayor  @FrancisSuarez  put 1% of the city’s treasury reserves in Bitcoin. My investment thesis is simple:  Find asymmetric upside by identifying opportunities that are contrarian today, but will be consensus in 3-5 years.  Optimize for slugging percentage, not batting average.  Bitcoin was great example. Many more to come. Bitcoin just hit a $500 billion market cap for the first time in history.  RIP bears  Bitcoin just hit a $470 billion market cap for the first time in history.  Half a trillion incoming fast. Bitcoin is up 240% in 2020. $25k on Dec 25th must mean Santa owns Bitcoin Bitcoin making a run at $25k on Christmas night.  You love to see it. Bitcoin hit a $450 billion market cap for the first time in history today. Bitcoin hitting a new all-time on Christmas Day is the energy I’m here for. Update:  @stoolpresidente  is finally ready to atone for his sins and weak hands.  We're setting up a Bitcoin wallet through  @TheGivingBlock  to help raise money for small businesses via the Barstool Fund.  I'll share the wallet address once we are ready. Stay tuned. The internet will break if Elon Musk converts any of Tesla’s balance sheet into Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a game of accumulation. Bitcoin is now a $420 billion market cap asset. Bitcoin has crossed a $400 billion market cap for the first time in history.   Only 20x away from gold’s market cap... Millions of randos littered throughout the world are beating every hedge fund on Wall Street for a decade plus by just holding Bitcoin.   Welcome to the new world. Many people never believed Bitcoin would hit $1.  Then they didn't believe $10.  Then they didn't believe $100.  Then they didn't believe $1,000.  Then they didn't believe $10,000.  Now they are refusing to believe $100,000.  We'll see :) Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s chief global strategist is talking about Bitcoin potentially replacing the dollar as the global reserve currency. “Nobody is going to ban Bitcoin.”  “We’re very focused on not killing this.” @BrianBrooksOCC  is doing one hell of a job pushing this whole industry forward right now. Wow. Paul Tudor Jones lays out a belief that Bitcoin is new gold and every sovereign nation will have a digital currency.  Starts around 6 min mark.   Remarkable comments to  @JuliaLaRoche  from one of the legends of Wall Street. BITCOIN JUST HIT A NEW ALL-TIME HIGH  I bought more bitcoin last night.  I bought more bitcoin this morning.  Dollar cost averaging and multi-year time horizons allow you to view price decreases as opportunities to buy a great asset on sale. Do your job and tell your family about Bitcoin this Thanksgiving My friend @michael_saylor continues to be an absolute legend.  This time on CNBC predicting that Apple and others will eventually convert their treasury assets into Bitcoin. In the last 12 months:  - S&P is up 14% - Gold is up 23% - Bitcoin is up 169%  Innovation drives returns and we are witnessing the adoption of one of the most disruptive pieces of technology in real time. JPMorgan now calling for $140k+ Bitcoin price.  Eventually everyone capitulates. JPMorgan market cap: $349 billion Bitcoin market cap: $350 billion  Checkmate, Jamie Dimon. Checkmate. Bitcoin went live on January 3, 2009.  It has been 4,339 days since then.  Bitcoin's market cap is $350 billion today.  That is more than $80 million in market cap added every day on average for 11 years.  $80+ million every single day. Bitcoin just hit a $350 billion market cap for the first time in history. We are about to witness one of the greatest bull markets in financial history.  There is rarely a financial asset that increases in market cap measured in hundreds of billions of dollars over a 12 month period.   It just hit me how historic this Bitcoin bull run will be. Bitcoin is up 154% in 2020. Bitcoin just hit a $325 billion market cap.  This is an all-time high for Bitcoin.  Congratulations to everyone who held through the bear market  LONG BITCOIN, SHORT THE BANKERS Bitcoin up 88% since the halving in May 2020.  Good thing I didn't listen to all those people who said it was priced in! Bitcoin is up 137% in 2020. Square put $50 million of their treasury assets (~ 1%) into Bitcoin on October 8th.  Less than 60 days later it is now worth more than $75 million.  Eventually every individual, company, and central bank will hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset. PayPal bringing Bitcoin and crypto to the masses in record speed  YouTube is down.  Bitcoin is never down. LOL there is a hedge fund manager who was saying Bitcoiners were scam artists & making ridiculous comments in the past on Twitter.  Just saw his fund's returns & Bitcoin outperformed him by 600% in 2019 and more than 1,000% so far this year.  He also deleted all his old tweets  I bought more Bitcoin today. Bitcoin is reminding everyone right now that it doesn't care who the President is. Important message as we enter the next Bitcoin bull market:  - BTC is very volatile - You can lose all of your money - Only invest what is ok to lose - Twitter is not investment advice - Don't buy BTC with credit cards - Keep low time preference - Do your own research Bitcoin is up 98% in 2020. Today is the 12th anniversary of the Bitcoin white paper being published.  That paper will likely go down as one of the most historically important documents in history. Bitcoin is now up 90% in 2020. The internet is going to break when Bitcoin breaks $20,000 ""I like #bitcoin  more now than I did at start. I think we're in the first inning and we have a long way to go.""  Imagine betting against Paul Tudor Jones. BREAKING: PayPal is announcing today that you will be able to buy, sell, and shop with Bitcoin and crypto on their platform.  Game on! Important message as we enter the next Bitcoin bull market:  - BTC is very volatile - You can lose all of your money - Only invest what is ok to lose - Twitter is not investment advice - Don't buy BTC with credit cards - Keep low time preference - Do your own research Someone should crowdfund a Bitcoin Super Bowl commercial I went on CNBC almost a year ago and said that the US must digitize the dollar immediately.  Nobody listened and now the US is behind China.  It ultimately won’t matter though because people will choose Bitcoin. Central banks want central bank digital currencies.  The people already have Bitcoin.  The first has unlimited supply and the second has a capped supply.  Not hard to guess where capital will flow over time. Bitcoin is going to explode when all the suits start buying it $10 billion asset management firm is holding $115 million worth of Bitcoin.  Having 0% exposure to Bitcoin at this point is the wrong answer. At this point, you’re violating your fiduciary duty if you invest capital on behalf of an institution & you have no exposure to Bitcoin.  Your job is to find the best risk-adjusted returns.  Nothing better than Bitcoin.   About time we all start saying it loudly, so they listen.

No one knows how many dollars there are. Everyone knows there are 21 million Bitcoin.  You can trust narratives or you can trust math.  Proceed as you wish.

Shareholders must demand that corporate executives protect their balance sheet's purchasing power. I'd love to talk to you if you're building decentralized applications, privacy focused technology, or Bitcoin infrastructure.  These are three of my biggest focuses for investing in 2021.

Everyone is underestimating this beast. Given the current circumstances, we are about to see which financial advisors are open minded & which ones are aren’t.  Basically every institution on Wall Street is buying bitcoin.  Are you gonna get your clients exposure now or do you still think you’re smarter than everyone?

The great people of India deserve the economic prosperity that digital sound money will usher in for them.  #IndiaWantsBitcoin The S&P is -99% denominated in Bitcoin over the last 5 years.  Can't make that up. Bitcoin becomes stronger every time someone around the world realizes that their government will print an unlimited amount of currency. Bitcoiners aren’t selling their bitcoin.  New bitcoiners are buying bitcoin & then taking them off exchanges.  This means that the available circulating supply is actually DECREASING at the same time demand is INCREASING.  Bang bang! Told you to expect bitcoin rocket fuel :) As bitcoin increases in value, I am so happy for the millions of every day citizens around the world who beat Wall Street to the best investment of the last decade.  The game has changed. Never bet against the internet. $60,000 bitcoin and stimulus checks hitting this weekend.  Oh my! This should be fun. REMINDER: Oil went negative and Chuck E.

The best investors in the last decade simply held bitcoin and resisted the urge to do anything else. [NEW POST] On-Chain Metrics Explain The Bitcoin Price Dip  While all the critics are celebrating an average price dip, the on-chain metrics show that we should be ready for liftoff soon.  Great analysis from  @WClementeIII  on this one! There was incredible economic chaos and uncertainty over the last 12 months.   Central banks around the world printed trillions of dollars and debased their currency.  Gold is up 4% and Bitcoin is up 680% in the same time period.  The market chose Bitcoin as the safe haven asset. GOOD MORNING. BITCOIN IS WINNING. HAVE A GREAT DAY :) “Gold invites violence.”  This is an absolute savage takedown of gold from @michael_saylor as he clearly explains why gold is inferior to bitcoin (h/t  @NeilJacobs ) It is going to be really hard for the government to ban bitcoin if all the politicians have laser eyes... Bitcoin has crashed to prices not seen since last week. It is laugh out loud funny to watch hedge fund managers and venture capitalists have historic meltdowns on Twitter because random people on the internet are outperforming them by simply buying bitcoin/crypto and holding it.

Here is what you need to know. There was more than $18 billion of bitcoin transaction volume done on-chain in the last 24 hours.   That is $6.5 trillion annualized or about 50% of Visa's annual transaction volume.  All done without needing permission from anyone.  Bitcoin is inevitable. Bitcoin has been under constant attack by the media, critics, and adversaries for the last 12 years.  It has withstood each and every attack, while growing to be a $1 trillion asset.  Bitcoin is anti-fragile. The attacks make it stronger. BREAKING: Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy just announced that they bought $15 million more of bitcoin.  @michael_saylor not only has strong hands, but he knows to buy the dip! More people will be buying Bitcoin because of Elon Musk’s comments.  This is the Streisand effect.  Stop the madness and pay attention to the facts. Bitcoin isn’t going anywhere. Elon Musk owns billions of dollars of bitcoin.  He isn’t selling because of this inaccurate energy narrative.  Don’t watch what they say, just watch what they do with their money. Bitcoin and crypto are the only free markets left. Every young person I know believes:  - Bitcoin is better than gold - Electric vehicles will win - Marijuana will be legal - Television is dead  Eventually everyone else will realize these too. Wall Street is a bet on the world staying the same.  Bitcoin and crypto is a bet on the world improving.   If you're satisfied with the world built by bankers, stay in the legacy system.  If you think society can do better, join the future system. Bitcoin is the fastest startup to $1 trillion in history. Bitcoin and the crypto industry is a bet that software is better than bankers. One of the largest public companies in Latin America,  @Mercadolibre , has purchased $7.8 million of bitcoin for their balance sheet.  Bitcoin is inevitable. All the Wall Street investors saying bitcoin is a religion forget that Berkshire Hathaway is their religion and Warren Buffett is their god. The Miami mayor is talking about mining bitcoin with nuclear energy and you still live in a city or state that hates bitcoin and the crypto industry.  Open your eyes. Leadership matters. Come to Miami :) Bitcoin is savings technology. BREAKING: Digital Currency Group just announced that they are going to purchase up to $750 million worth of the Graycale Bitcoin Trust.   This is 3x the original $250 million they announced a few weeks ago. Bitcoin is freedom technology. During the 2018 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, Buffett called bitcoin ""rat poison squared"" and Munger called it ""a turd.""  Bitcoin was ~ $9,800 at the time.   They would have been better off buying bitcoin instead of sitting on all that cash that has been devalued.... ""Bitcoin is probably less volatile than similar sized assets like Apple stock or even Tesla stock.” -  @cz_binance  on Bloomberg TV Charlie Munger on bitcoin today:  “I should say modestly that I think whole damn development is disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization.”  He owns banks that launder billions per year & have been charged criminally.  Give me a break. The bears are quiet as bitcoin creeps back over $40,000 and the dream of bitcoin's demise disappears once again... DeFi on Bitcoin is the most mispriced opportunity in the entire industry.  If successful, it renders most of current DeFi projects unnecessary.  Low probability of success, but incredible asymmetric payoff if it occurs.  Exactly why I backed  @SovrynBTC . Floyd Mayweather will be speaking at the Bitcoin Conference. If you think this dip caused hysteria and fear, wait until the next one in a month or two.   The bears will be back saying that bitcoin is dead for the nine millionth time. Bitcoin is freedom.   Anyone telling you otherwise has an interest in you not being free. Lessons from Bitcoin dip for newbies:  1. Hodl, don’t day trade 2. Don’t use leverage 3. Size your position 4. Ignore the FUD 5. Be patient  Remember these for next time :) Bitcoin is up 19% in the last 24 hours.  Fundamentals never changed, FUD just got louder.   Stay focused on what matters. Bitcoin is a bet that the academics and economists don’t know what they’re doing. BREAKING: Ray Dalio has purchased bitcoin. Can't believe I even have to say this, but the noise is just FUD. The underlying thesis hasn't changed at all.  Central banks are printing trillions of dollars. Authoritarian regimes are only becoming more aggressive.   Bitcoin is the peaceful solution. I'm as bullish as ever. There is a special kind of stupid required for bitcoin & crypto bears to yell “I was right!” after the asset class was the single best performer through the pandemic & economic crisis.  If you can’t handle volatility that has been here for years, go buy negative yielding bonds. The on-chain metrics overwhelmingly show that new bitcoin holders are selling to the people who have been around for years.  Weak, new hands selling to strong, long-term hands. The Bitcoin Energy Czar  @nic__carter  has spoken.   Educate yourself. [NEW POST] Who Was Buying And Selling During This Week's Bitcoin Price Crash  This is excellent analysis of the on-chain data from  @WClementeIII . Probably the best explanation I've seen of what exactly happened earlier this week. If this tweet gets 5,000 likes then I'll fly to NYC and throw a massive pizza party on Saturday for Bitcoin Pizza day.  Everyone will be invited. I'll buy 100 pizzas and we'll have an absolute blast celebrating somewhere.  Internet do your thing  Bitcoin back to $42,000 already.  Volatility is part of the game.  Think long-term and chill. ""Bitcoin forever"" - @michael_saylor There is nothing more frustrating than trying to buy bitcoin on sale but every exchange struggling under the high traffic.  Teams across the industry are working their asses off this morning to keep things running. We never appreciate them enough  Bitcoin bull markets are highly volatile.   In 2017, there were two separate drawdowns of 40% during the year.  They never are fun, but this is normal stuff for historical comparison. Bitcoin is up 327% in the last 12 months. People keep asking why we aren't accepting bitcoin for Bitcoin Pizza.   Order here: http://eatbitcoinpizza.com  Today I am announcing Bitcoin Pizza - a new national pizza brand that is launching in 10 cities.  The first pizzas will be delivered this Saturday, which is the 11 year anniversary of the infamous bitcoin pizza transaction.  Buy pizza: http://eatbitcoinpizza.com  REMINDER: Majority of bitcoin miners use renewable energy. Bitcoin will humble anyone. Bitcoin exposes everyone. The same people yelling FUD also own billions of dollars of bitcoin.  Don't get distracted. Everyone wants cheap bitcoin. The anti-bitcoin crowd used to be Keynesian economists who yelled “sound money is dumb!”  Then they became statists yelling “the government will ban bitcoin!”  Now they’re environmentalists yelling “bitcoin is bad for environment!”  They just move from one bad take to another... Stock market closed.  Banks closed.  Bitcoin open. The error that most bitcoin critics make is that they can’t argue the pro-bitcoin points better than bitcoiners.  As Charlie Munger famously said, “I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don’t know the other side’s argument better than they do.” Here is a video of Mexico’s third wealthiest man explaining why he believes all fiat currencies are a fraud and he wants to hold bitcoin over the next 30 years.  Incredible to see this from  @RicardoBSalinas  given his historic wealth and success. If this tweet gets 5,000 likes then I'll convince  @CashApp  to give away more bitcoin today.   Internet do your thing. Tanzania’s central bank banned bitcoin & cryptocurrencies a few years ago.  The President of Tanzania recently told them to knock it off and go figure out how to embrace the technology.   Now the central bank is doing their homework.  Leadership matters. Jack Dorsey just invited Elon Musk to have THE talk about bitcoin.  I'm giving away $500,000 in bitcoin today   My friends at  @CashApp  are helping me make sure as many people are stacking sats as possible.  In order to win some bitcoin, reply with your $cashtag and #PayMeInBitcoin.  Let's get it!! Good luck :) Bitcoin is the most dependable central bank in the world. This morning a bunch of folks were screaming bitcoin was going lower.  Now those people are screaming that bitcoin is going higher.  Nobody knows what is going to happen to price in the short term.  Stop trying to day trade a highly volatile asset.  Think long term & chill. REMINDER: Majority of the bitcoin bulls are heavily invested in the asset, while nearly none of the bears are shorting it.  Stop listening to what people say and simply see who has true skin in the game. Bitcoin is under $30,000.  Here is a quick thread to document what I'm thinking right now and what my strategy is during these price drawdowns. Countries are adopting bitcoin & billionaires are scooping them up like candy, yet you're selling because some anonymous account drew lines on a chart.  This applies to every asset class — stop pretending to be a day trader & start learning how to be a long term asset allocator. BREAKING: Michael Saylor and Microstrategy have purchased another 13,005 bitcoin for about $490 million.  They now own over 105,000 bitcoin and have no plans of selling any of them. [NEW POST] Bitcoin Is Heavily Oversold & Strong Hands Can't Stop Buying @WClementeIII  breaks down this week's on-chain metrics and explains how strong, long-term holders are accumulating at an incredible rate right now.  The on-chain metrics don't lie :) Bitcoin is the most predictable monetary policy in the world. You can't kill bitcoin because you can't kill an idea that has been accepted by 100+ million people around the world. ""Listen, I like Bitcoin right. Bitcoin is math…I like the idea of investing in something that’s reliable, consistent, honest, and 100% certain. So Bitcoin has appealed to me because it’s a way for me to invest in certainty."" - Paul Tudor Jones  (h//t  @JuliaLaRoche ) Paul Tudor Jones says he wants 5% of his portfolio in bitcoin and he doesn't even look at the price anymore. Banks closed.  Bitcoin open. The most important people in bitcoin are the every day citizens that stack sats, hold, and enjoy their newfound freedom. The bitcoin bears are on the wrong side of history. The Wall Street suits can only survive if money is printed, markets are manipulated, and risk is removed.  They can’t thrive in a free market like bitcoin. The IMF is not happy about El Salvador's decision to make bitcoin legal tender. Individuals are adopting bitcoin. Billionaires are adopting bitcoin. Banks are adopting bitcoin. Corporations are adopting bitcoin. Governments are adopting bitcoin.  History will show that bitcoiners were right all along. Name an anti-bitcoin politician that doesn’t depend on banks, financial institutions, or legacy payment processors for donations.  I’ll wait.... FREE IDEA: If you run a country, adopt bitcoin.  It is very good for business. Bitcoin is censorship resistant and it is an open monetary network.    El Salvador is focused on embracing the open nature of the bitcoin network.  “Open systems beat closed systems.” -  @jackmallers Overview of last 4 days in El Salvador:  1. President announces BTC adoption 2. Simple 3 page bill is presented 3. Government votes & approves bill 4. President joins Twitter to speak candidly  Impossible to see a situation where the United States government could move this fast. We meme'd bitcoin into legal tender in a country.   Bitcoiners can do anything. If you sell your bitcoin with the hope of buying it back at a lower price, you don't understand bitcoin.

Bitcoin was never in a bear market.   The critics got louder and new people got scared.  The strong hands were accumulating heavily the last few weeks though.

Satoshi wanted to signal to everyone that Bitcoin wasn’t a scam:  - No premine - 2 months heads up before launching the network - Coins had no value for 1.5 years so circulated freely (not replicable) - Unlike every other founder in history, Satoshi never cashed out 12 years since Wall Street crashed our economy:  -The 5 biggest banks have made $600B -Execs at the 5 biggest banks have been paid $4B  Meanwhile:  -Not one bank exec has gone to jail for it -The bottom 90% are still poorer than they were in 2007  That's why we have Bitcoin. $7 trillion is on the US Fed balance sheet.   $3 trillion was printed this year alone.   $1 trillion in the last 30 days.   ---   There's only one way out of this.

When will they realize that Bitcoin is unstoppable?  I’m not a Democrat.  I’m not a Republican.  I’m a member of the Bitcoin party  The Bitcoin bull run is just getting started. Bitcoin = $1k. First they ignore you.  Bitcoin = $10k. Then they laugh at you. Bitcoin = $100k. Then they fight you.  Bitcoin = $1M. Then you win. 98% of retirement accounts in the US can’t access #Bitcoin.   That’s $36,800,000,000,000.  What happens when they do? Bitcoin is only a 20% move away from breaking all time highs. Bitcoin has a 99.98% uptime  Higher than Amazon Higher than Facebook Higher than Google Higher than the US Government   Good luck trying to stop it. One of the best Bitcoin memes of all time. This is my third Bitcoin bull run.  In previous bull runs, Q4 is the main show We wouldn't need Bitcoin:  - If we could trust banks - If we could trust people - If we could trust the government   But we can't. That's why we need Plan ₿ Jack Dorsey is stepping down as CEO of Twitter.   Excited to see  @jack 's full focus on Square and Bitcoin! Inflation   2020: “monitoring” 2021: “Transitory”  2022: “Under control” 2023: “Bitcoin did this” US Government: #Bitcoin could destabilize the Dollar.  Reality: The US Government is destabilizing the Dollar through QE, deficit spending, and stimulus.

Protect yourself.  Buy #Bitcoin #Bitcoin just made its highest weekly close ever at $65.5K!   Buckle up.   This week is about to be wild. I’m excited to see all the new tech built on Bitcoin now that Taproot is here! People that own #Bitcoin:  - Tim Cook - Jack Dorsey - Elon Musk - Stan Druckenmiller - Bill Miller - Paul Tudor Jones  It's probably just a fad.  Bitcoin's new protocol update, Taproot, gets activated this weekend!  Apple CEO Tim Cook owns Bitcoin! #Bitcoin just broke ATH! Jeffries, a $450B asset manager, has sold a portion of its gold allocation to purchase #Bitcoin.  Eventually every asset manager in the world will do this.  Buckle up.  #Bitcoin #Bitcoin is the most predictable thing in an unpredictable world. #Bitcoin will go up forever because the dollar is designed to go down forever. When Bitcoin flippens gold, each Bitcoin will be worth $475K.  Plan accordingly. ",INTJ,0.0514
 tyler,"At some point people will wake up and realize that bitcoin is the best safe haven asset the world has ever seen. Until then, opportunity abounds. Crypto used to be where you ended up when you couldn’t make it on Wall Street. The quality of Goldman Sachs’ recent research on #Bitcoin demonstrates that there has been a talent flippening. Today, Wall Street is where you end up when you can’t make it in crypto. Goldman Sachs aka Bankers aka Wall Street still don't get (or want to get) #Bitcoin. It's ok, because everyone else does. This may cause some governments to rethink their gold strategy. #Bitcoin The Internet has made it possible for you to become your own broadcaster and media empire (e.g.,  @joerogan ). Bitcoin allows you to become your own bank. I love the freedom and independence that technology can bring to the world. Bitcoin is not magic, funny money. That's the U.S. dollar and the Fed cc  @jk_rowling . The Bitcoin Halving was momentous, I'm still soaking it all in. It's incredible to think of just how much a crazy band of believers accomplished in the last 4 years. The most exciting part? We're just beginning... One of the smartest and most successful investors of the last quarter century is now long Bitcoin. Wall Street is coming...  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-tudor-jones-buys-bitcoin-165520128.html… The Fed has set the stage for the rise of bitcoin; the pandemic has set the stage for the rise of Big Brother.  For something that has ""died"" so many times, bitcoin sure is stayin' alive. Bitcoin is not a hedge to pandemics, it is a hedge to fiat regimes. A sudden, negative demand shock in the global economy’ will affect every asset, including gold, in the short term. Bitcoin was born in 2008, during the winter of our financial discontent. It has already weathered much to be here, and it seems unlikely to give up anytime soon. It will emerge from this current calamity stronger than ever. Decades are not measured in days. The Fed, under the leadership of Jerome Powell, continues to be #Bitcoin's biggest booster. On Thursday, he will deliver a speech about how the Fed will begin targeting higher inflation.  I am COVID negative. The only thing I have is the #Bitcoin and crypto virus which I gave to  @stoolpresidente . It’s overwhelming at first, but once you start stacking sats, you will have long term immunity to all of the insanity in the world. I always get excited when #Bitcoin hovers around a price level for a while. Like a caged animal, it's getting more and more ready to break out. Attention #Bitcoin newcomers, you don't have to buy a full bitcoin, you can buy any fraction of a bitcoin that you want — even as little as 0.00000001 (called a ""satoshi"") is possible. This is what Bitcoiners mean when they say they're ""stacking satoshis"" or ""stacking sats."" #Bitcoin rocketing through 12K on Monday morning is much more energizing and a large cold brew. #DDTG aka  @stoolpresidente  is diving headfirst into #Bitcoin  #Bitcoin is the only long-term hedge to all the inflation that's coming... People ask me all the time if it's too late to buy #Bitcoin. I tell them that it's the bottom of the first inning and that one day they'll look back and understand just how early it is. #Bitcoin is the greatest social network of all time. #Bitcoin is gold with wings. And #Bitcoin has breached 12k. Great way to start the week! Now Goldman Sachs is into #Bitcoin. What an about face from their ""Don't Buy Bitcoin"" Report issued 3 months ago in May. Nice head fake vampire squid. Tomorrow, they will be changing their name to ""Goldman Stacking Sats.""  https://msn.com/en-us/money/markets/goldman-names-new-head-of-digital-assets-in-bet-that-blockchain-is-the-future-of-financial-markets/ar-BB17Eq0h… There are times on the #Bitcoin journey that can be lonely. Your friends think you’re crazy, people ridicule you. But we’re entering a time period when again Bitcoiners will be considered the smartest people in the room. #Bitcoin is the most inclusive investment and financial asset that world has ever seen. Bitcoin is mooning Bitcoin will set you free When money printer go brrrr and inflate the stonks market, it’s time to bitcoin. Bitcoin is trending. Earlier today, Twitter accounts were hijacked in an attempt to trick individuals into sending bitcoin to addresses owned by the attackers.  @Gemini  immediately added these addresses to our blocklist to prevent our customers from inadvertently falling victim to this scam. Bitcoin marks the beginning of the end for surveillance capitalism. This is why bitcoin is gold 2.0. It’s mathematically impossible to counterfeit. Bitcoin requires no guns, government money does. Which do you think is stronger? Bitcoin is the first time in the history of the world that people have reached peaceful agreement around billions of dollars in economic value. The price of ether $ETH right now is $735. This is 51% off of its all-time-high, which is like buying #Bitcoin at 14k. What a steal. I’m going to break 300k followers by the New Year and #Bitcoin is going to break 30k. Let’s get this party started  The #Bitcoin price has appreciated 300% this year #Bitcoin’s market cap is 500 billion. Gold’s market cap is 9 trillion. That’s atleast 18x appreciation from here when bitcoin disrupts gold. #Bitcoin’s market cap is now 500 billion. It’s impact will be far more profound than any company, yet there are companies 2x more valuable than it. It’s still so early #StimulusCheck is trending right now, which means #Bitcoin will be trending and pumping again soon #Bitcoin just finished day at highest close ever Merry Christmas! No coal this year, #Bitcoin 24.5k instead  Ho ho ho!  Staggering fact I can stop thinking about. Today, debt-to-GDP ratio is 135%. It was 121% during WWII. Back then we had record employment and record production. Today, we have record unemployment and low production. #Bitcoin is the only compass to navigate these uncharted waters. When  @elonmusk  puts the $TSLA balance sheet into #Bitcoin, we'll have to change the BTC rallying cry from ""to the moon!"" to ""to Mars!"" #Bitcoin is the perfect hedge for these times Every high net worth and ultra high net worth individual in the world heard about #Bitcoin in 2017. This is the first time they are actually doing something about it and buying it in bulk. Another highly sophisticated hedge fund is buying 1 billion worth of #Bitcoin and #Ether  “There is going to be a generational allocation to this new asset class,” Peters said. “The flows have only just begun.” In the future, the period in U.S. history known as the 'Roaring Twenties' will be about #Bitcoin Btw, #Bitcoin is just getting started How #Bitcoin stacks up against the rest #Bitcoin has just breached 21k! To moon we go! #Bitcoin is has reached a new all-time-high, having busted through 20k. Smartest people in the room are jumping into #Bitcoin #Bitcoin street art in the heart of Hong Kong. Spartans HODL! Everyone is excited that the stock market is all time highs. That’s wonderful, but these are fantasy gains inflated and pumped up by the Fed’s money printing.   Meanwhile, #Bitcoin has grown by 15x more with no money printing at all. That’s real. If #Bitcoin is only used a store of value, it will be conservatively worth 500k per bitcoin one day. If it also becomes widely used as a medium of exchange, the price will be much higher. ""Digital currencies such as #Bitcoin are making the U.S. dollar less relevant."" The trade of the century is still available. The next few hedge fund managers who take 100mil or greater #Bitcoin position, will become the best investors of their generation. Similar to George Soros when he broke the pound. Bitcoin has 30x from here; that's 100mil into 3 billion This #Bitcoin bull run is different. It’s being driven by highly sophisticated investors like Paul Tudor Jones and Stan Druckenmiller, as well as publicly traded companies like MicroStrategy $MSTR and Square $SQ investing their treasury. Soon it will be driven by Central Banks. #Bitcoin is up 175% YTD and will be the best performing asset of the decade. Read all about it! #Bitcoin is the key to your financial sovereignty and wealth creation and preservation That fact that we don’t know who Satoshi is yet #Bitcoin’s market cap is $330 billion, is a testament to the fact that Bitcoin speaks for itself #Bitcoin is within $500 of its all-time-high of 19,800 set 3yrs ago in December 2017. Let’s do this! #Bitcoin is still 4% below its all-time high of $19,800 set 3 years ago in December 2017. This bull run hasn't even started yet. #Bitcoin is now larger than the world's biggest banks A lot of people spend time contemplating the risks surrounding #Bitcoin. They completely miss the biggest risk of all, which is to sit on the sidelines and passively watch the greatest money and technological revolution of the century unfold before their eyes. Your dollars are to the fax machine as #Bitcoin is to email Money stored in a bank will get run over. Money invested in assets like real estate or the stock market will keep pace. Money stored in gold or #Bitcoin will outrun the scourge of inflation. And money stored in bitcoin will run the fastest, overtaking gold. #Bitcoin is getting ready to moon   CitiBank report calls #Bitcoin digital gold of the 21st century. Says devaluation of the US dollar formed the basis of the report and the comparison of bitcoin to the gold. Watch US Senator Cynthia Lummis extol the virtues of #Bitcoin as a store of value! Cash is owning a piece of the past, #Bitcoin is owning a piece of the future HODL be thy name.   Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth, as it is on the moon!  Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from fiat: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory of #Bitcoin. Amen. #Bitcoin has busted through 16k. Next stop 17k, and then the moon!  The smartest people in the room believe in #Bitcoin The smartest people in the room own #Bitcoin The #Bitcoin vaccine is 100% effective against inflation This is code for buy #Bitcoin #Bitcoin has already doubled this year. It closed 2019 at 7k, now it’s on its way to 15k and we’re just getting started #Bitcoin will be the big winner tonight #Bitcoin roaring, but it's still 5K below it's all-time-high 3yrs ago. Party is just getting started  I do think we will see an all-time-high price for #Bitcoin before 2020 is over. Even though the price has climbed from 10k to almost 14k in less than a month, it hasn't really gone on a breakout run yet. When we start to see 3-5k surges then the bulls will be on the run The most financially sophisticated people I know, who do not work in crypto, all have taken positions in #Bitcoin in the last 6 months. This quiet groundswell of demand is the reason bitcoin is on its way to 14k and beyond. JP Morgan analysts think #Bitcoin could triple in value and challenge gold. While I think its at least like a 45x from here, not a 3x, at least we can agree that bitcoin is going up . It's hard to understand why anyone wouldn't own BTC by now. And we’ve breached 13k #Bitcoin. Here we go 14k! #Bitcoin. Slowly, then suddenly... #Bitcoin busts through 12k, 15k here we come! If there ever was a time to own #Bitcoin, that time has come. Even before COVID-19, and despite the longest bull run in U.S. economic history, the government was spending money like a drunken sailor, cutting taxes like Crazy Eddie, and printing money like a banana republic. #Bitcoin quietly consolidating within striking distance of 12k. Love it Few understand this. But, It's only a matter of time before everyone eventually does. #Bitcoin #Bitcoin looking strong. Poised for a breakout bull run into the New Year. Jeff Bezos' recalling raising money for Amazon: ""It took more than 50 meetings for me to raise $1 million from investors, and over the course of all those meetings, the most common question was, “What’s the internet?”  Sums up my early experiences telling people about #Bitcoin Email kicked off an information revolution. #Bitcoin and crypto are ushering in a money revolution. Don’t leave yourself behind. Breaking: White House is proposing a new $1.8 trillion dollar advertisement campaign for #Bitcoin. To the moon! First, it was @michael_saylor and publicly traded  @MicroStrategy  buying $425million of #Bitcoin. Today, it is  @jack  and  @square  buying $50million of bitcoin. Tomorrow, it will be another visionary leader, and another, and another...the tsunami is coming #Bitcoin is all about the Long Game I've never been more bullish on #Bitcoin and ether Wow, the Bank of England discussing negative interest rates. If they adopt this, they would be paying you to borrow. You couldn’t buy a better advertisement for #Bitcoin but u can take their money and go long bitcoin  The European Central Bank’s refinancing rate is 0% and its deposit rate is -.5%. This means it is free to borrow money, but actually costs you money to save.  This is both a potent recipe for inflation and powerful advertisement for #Bitcoin If you don’t own #bitcoin right now, your position is long USD shitcoin and short bitcoin. Think about that for a moment. Software is eating the world and gold is on the menu. #Bitcoin #bitcoin at 45k smells of opportunity Banks are closed, stock markets are closed, but #bitcoin is open Square $SQ has purchased another $170 million worth of #bitcoin Every single time in history that #bitcoin has hit a certain price and then retraced, it eventually reached that price again and went even higher. The story is #bitcoin has always been two steps forward, one step back, then two steps forward. Few understand this. #Bitcoin is firmly worth more than $1 trillion dollars. 9 more to go until the gold flippening $BTC and $ETH are sending it today I have turned into an angry robot until #bitcoin hits 100k #Bitcoin market cap has hit 1 trillion The  @PurposeInvest  #Bitcoin ETF launched in Canada today on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In its first day of trading, it was already the 17th most active stock in Canada! To the Moon!  #Bitcoin history was made today.  @PurposeInvest  launched North America's first #bitcoin ETF on the Toronto Stock Exchange. It traded over $100MM in volume today.  @Gemini  Custody secures all the BTC for this fund and  @Gemini  Clearing clears every BTC transaction for this ETF.  #bitcoin market cap is still below $1 trillion. It's so early. #bitcoin 50k is about to become the new normal And we a new #bitcoin all-time-high ladies and gentleman. Bitcoin has breached 50k.  Less than $500 dollars between #bitcoin breaking 50k The U.S. dollar is a risk-on asset, #bitcoin is risk-off asset Instead of flowers today, consider #Bitcoin  And soon there will be no bank left who is not in #bitcoin #bitcoin is a referendum on central bankers. They don't like it because it's a foil of accountability to their behavior. A reminder to them of when they get it wrong, and ultimately a threat to their monopoly of power over money and their job security. Dear #Bitcoin  short-sellers,  Have fun getting rekt!  -Tyler #Bitcoin back up above 48k Slowly, then suddenly. America's oldest bank is now getting into #Bitcoin #Bitcoin is the best asset in the galaxy to secure your financial future The question that every public company CEO will now have to answer on their next earnings call: ""Why don't you own #Bitcoin?"" 50k #bitcoin here we come Good morning Asia, you are waking up to some amazing #Bitcoin news today ;) #Bitcoin is trending $TSLA said it bought #Bitcoin for ""more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash.""  The message here is that cash is trash. #TSLSA traded its cash in for hard, sound money. The money printer is getting ready to go brrrr for another 1.9 trillion dollar advertisement for #Bitcoin #Bitcoin market cap is $730billion. There still are individual companies that are more value. Crazy how early it is. #Bitcoin has quietly crept above 40k #Bitcoin has broken 39k. People are starting to realize that centralized finance sucks Ether $ETH at 1.6k, #bitcoin at 37k The hedge funds didn’t learn their lesson with GameStop $GME. They have started to short #bitcoin ...good luck with that  ""I am a supporter of #bitcoin.""  - @elonmusk Miami and  @FrancisSuarez  are leading the way for governments and #Bitcoin Another bullshit nonsensical excuse from Robinhood.  @Gemini  is completely open for #bitcoin and crypto trading Some more good news. Legendary investor  @RayDalio , who runs the world's largest hedge fund Bridgewater, is into #bitcoin #bitcoin in bio This is the beginning of the end for centralized finance. Wall Street Bets community — welcome to #Bitcoin #Ethereum and #DeFi Em resposta a  @WSBChairman Big News: Ninepoint's Bitcoin Trust, has raised $180 million and just IPO'd on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Proud that  @Gemini  Custody is the custodian. To the moon!  If I was the CEO of $AMC, the next move would be to purchase #Bitcoin and put it on the balance sheet. Nice, #Bitcoin has climbed above 34k while you were sleeping. If you haven't heard already, it's still alive #Bitcoin is the most trustworthy money in the world. The trick? It requires no trust in humans, only math. The amount of hedge fund managers and investors that I’ve been talking to lately about #Bitcoin has never been greater. Even the most conservative of them are worried about the future of the US dollar. They all want to learn how to stack sats to protect their funds and themselves People spend US dollars because they are dangerous to hold. People HODL #Bitcoin because it’s dangerous to spend. All money is faith-based. The difference with #Bitcoin is that you place your faith in math, not central bankers. Journo tried to kill #Bitcoin today with FUD. Newsflash, won’t work, we’ve been here before. We know the drill. Stay calm and stack on. Big News: Blackrock CEO, leader of a trillion dollar asset manager, says #Bitcoin could “evolve into a global market asset” This is completely false. #Bitcoin is mainly used by citizens to protect themselves against the incompetence and gross negligence of central bankers. Big News: Blackrock, a trillion dollar asset manager, getting into the #Bitcoin game #Bitcoin is a system of rules, not rulers #Bitcoin protects your life’s work The majority of people have, and will continue to underestimate #Bitcoin's impact on the world. Therein lies the opportunity Gresham's law: ""bad money drives out good."" The US dollar (bad money) causes people to HODL good money (#Bitcoin). The fact that bitcoin is not being spent is evidence that it is good, sound money. The US dollar is spent because it is bad money that loses value over time. Money is a technology. Like any technology, money can always be improved upon and iterated on. #Bitcoin and crypto are its latest evolution. #Bitcoin is sound money #Bitcoin is a rage against the machine Inflation destroys the fruits of your labor, #Bitcoin protects them Another multi-trillion dollar advertisement for #Bitcoin While you were sleeping, #Bitcoin crawled back to 40k #Bitcoin consolidating at 34k. This is good for a few reasons, 1) market cooling off a bit before next surge is not a bad thing, allows it to build more support at a higher baseline, 2) if you missed BTC on the way up to 41k, you can get it now. #Bitcoin is gold 2.0. Ether $ETH is decentralized Amazon cloud computing.  @Filecoin  $FIL is decentralized Amazon cloud storage. Zcash $ZEC is decentralized, private money. $DAI is a decentralized stablecoin. All of the pieces of the decentralization movement are coming together. #Bitcoin is still up 10% year-to-date and it’s only 11 days into the new year. Just the beginning, get ready For every one who missed 33k #Bitcoin last time, nows your chance 23.6% of all U.S. dollars were created last year. Cash is trash. #Bitcoin is your only protection from the rampant inflation that is at our doorstep. #Bitcoin and Ether $ETH fix this Your bank is closed right now, but #Bitcoin and Ether $ETH are open for business #Bitcoin is the answer There are still companies in the world that are worth more than #Bitcoin. Crazy. #Bitcoin is trending right now #Bitcoin 40k, check ! #Bitcoin looking strong right at 34k. Ether $ETH looking cheap at 1.1k 12 years ago today, #Bitcoin was born.

Bitcoin ETF is trending The ridicule and vitriol leveled at NFTs today by the traditional art world is reminiscent of how Wall Street and central bankers spoke of #bitcoin 10 years ago. And we all know how the story has been unfolding. You can now buy a Tesla with #bitcoin First they ridicule you, then they want to be you. #Bitcoin #Bitcoin is not just money, it's the greatest teacher The Internet gave us digital abundance. #Bitcoin gave us digital scarcity. #Bitcoin continues to go mainstream. Slowly, then suddenly. Many understand this. There are almost 3 billion video game players worldwide.  Do you think they prefer gold or #bitcoin?   Do you think they prefer cash or crypto?  Do you think they prefer physical art or NFTs?  Do you think they prefer Wall Street or DeFi? #Bitcoin is your best defense against the Fed #Bitcoin 60k is trending...yeehaw! #4WordsBetterThanSex   #bitcoin all-time-high Good morning 60k #bitcoin #bitcoin is a journey of truth about the nature of money.

Big News: El Salvador  announced that they will make #Bitcoin legal tender and have bitcoin in their reserves.

REMINDER: #Bitcoin is the best protection in the world against inflation 56% of Bitcoin mining uses renewable energy according to the Bitcoin Mining Council.

Bullish. Elon, Tesla, and SpaceX own #Bitcoin Bitcoin above 47k on Friday the 13th.  Bitcoin hit 45k, next stop, 50k Bitcoin has succeeded by providing a better alternative.

Why? Scarcity, network effects, hodlers, QE ... time will tell. Must read thread. This is exactly how I see current financial markets as well. #bitcoin might be(come) the last asset not yet mortgaged. Some people think S2F model broke yesterday. Of course it did not. #bitcoin oscillated nicely around model value and stayed well within model bands. The extreme volatility within the model bands shakes out the weak hands.

ICYMI - #Bitcoin and S&P500 are correlated (95% R2) and cointegrated (so probably not spurious) - Current S&P level implies BTC $18K (or S&P to go down) - This is consistent with S2FX model: $288K BTC at S2F56 -> it implies $4300 S&P - Money printing (QE) pumps both S&P and BTC #Bitcoin S2FX Phases 1: Pizza, GPU miner, Silk Road, MtGox 2: >$1, Wikileaks, Satoshi Dice, Coinbase, Halving1 3: >$100, Cyprus, Bitstamp, Ulbricht arrest, MtGox default, XT fork, Halving2 4: >$1000, JPN&AUS legalize BTC, Altcoins/ICO, BCH/SV forks, Segwit/LN, Futures, Halving3 #Bitcoin looking sharp after shrugging off: - 2017 CME futures FOMO & hangover - 2018 US government ICO crackdown - 2018 SEC approval ETF hope & delusion  - 2018 BSV fork - 2019 Bakkt futures fear & relieve - 2020 Corona virus #Bitcoin priced in Gold .. USD out of the equation IMO investors cannot ignore this. If you dollar cost average into #bitcoin for 12 months, then wait 12 months, and then DCA out 12 months, this chart shows your return (investment=1). So DCA in 2017, wait 2018, DCA out 2019 yields 1.7 or +70% return.  Odds:  13% <1 19% 1-2 68% >2 Forbes on #Bitcoin Stock-To-Flow In 2017 #bitcoin jumped from $10K to $16.6K in 7 days (and to $20K ATH in 17 days) See the two blue dots on the right? That's May and June, zooming in on post-halving S2F level of 50+. Next: market value .. #bitcoin phase5 in the making! For the connoisseurs: red dot on #bitcoin S2FX model, will this be the start of the bull market again? In 2012-2013 and 2016-2017 red dots started the transition to a new phase. #Phase5  #bitcoin = 15 ounces of gold. Up from 5 ounces end 2019 and 3 in 2018. Note there is no USD in this formula or chart. This is the pure S2F effect without QE / Brrr. 100x gold implies $188K bitcoin (at current gold prices; gold will probably increase in price due to QE). #bitcoin bull run picking up steam #Bitcoin versus FED+ECB balance sheet (QE)  In case you have not read the original #bitcoin S2F and S2FX model articles, you can find them here: https://100trillionusd.github.io #bitcoin price $25.3K above S2F model value $24.9K real time S2F charts: https://digitalik.net/btc/ #Bitcoin $24K, Merry Christmas! #bitcoin 200WMA increasing faster and faster #bitcoin looking strong, despite US KYC/AML crap #phase5 $1B in #Bitcoin . “There is going to be a generational allocation to this new asset class. The flows have only just begun.” - CEO Eric Peters Chart update: #bitcoin S2F (time series only) model. BTC price (red dots) moves nicely towards model line (white line), just like 2017 and 2013. And .. do I see a little orange? #bitcoin outperforms ALL other assets: more return AND less risk (yes you read that correctly ""less risk"") ""It might make sense just to get some [#bitcoin] in case it catches on. If enough people [and companies] think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling prophecy."" - Satoshi Nakamoto #bitcoin pausing before orange and yellow Watch how traders, shitcoiners and weak hands transfer their #bitcoin to strong hands like Grayscale, Paypal, Square, MicroStrategy etc. These BTC will disappear from the market and go into deep cold storage and stay there for years. #bitcoin 200WMA $7500 (monthly increase 5.5%), looks like late 2016 / early 2017. #bitcoin and central bank balance sheets (money 'printing') have gone hand in hand last 10 years .. but now BTC is lagging behind .. about two orders of magnitude (100X). Room for growth? #bitcoin looking strong, RSI 75, when RSI 95? #bitcoin stock-to-flow cross asset model -if BTC doesn't break it's historical path -BTC market cap will approach gold market value $5-10T in 2021-2024 -and approach real estate market value $10-100T in 2024-2028 -after 2028 we can no longer interpolate and enter uncharted waters Tomorrow is Monday! Paypal, Grayscale, Square etc will resume buying #bitcoin. Are you ready? #Bitcoin is a fast growing country in cyberspace, with a population of sovereign individuals who prefer to use BTC for storing wealth and doing transactions: - monetary base $330B (#34 largest country) - population 10M (#92 largest country of the world) https://cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2215rank.html… It always amuses my when there is simultaneous China FUD and government banning / regulating FUD on illiquid #bitcoin market moments (Thanksgiving etc). Classic. Don't let them take your coins. #phase5 ""Are you a software company or a bitcoin hedge fund?"" #phase5  ""Physically backed (100% Bitcoin collateralized)"" US soon? Slowly but surely this is beginning to look like (the start of) a bull market. Best ever #bitcoin month in $ terms (+$5400) and RSI crawling towards bull market levels. Current #bitcoin price action is nice, but we are waiting for a real jump (like the red arrows early 2013 and 2017). IMO that will be the start of the real bull market, and indeed phase5. January 2021? ""Bitcoin actually is the scarcest asset in the world, based on stock-to-flow measure""  @MarkYusko #bitcoin $18K. Big difference with 2017 is that most BTC sold today will never see the daylight again, they disappear into deep cold storage. Buyers today are professionals with long term vision and staying power. 1 month later #bitcoin is 9 ounces of gold .. significant indeed  Beautiful to see the birth of #bitcoin phase5 in real time! Red dots will tun orange, yellow, green and slowly crawl towards S2FX model line (black linear line) and gold. #bitcoin Chart update of the #bitcoin S2F (time series only) model. Price dots moving nicely towards model line. S2F multiple (white dots) rising. #bitcoin monthly RSI>70 .. momentum is building Now watch how those bitcoins that some dumb weak hand sellers sold in big chucks last 4 hours will be sucked up by strong hand buyers with hundreds of smart small 0.01 BTC algo buys. Those BTC will disappear in deep cold storage People ask if I still believe in my model. To be clear: I have no doubt whatsoever that #bitcoin S2FX is correct and #bitcoin will tap $100K-288K before Dec2021. In fact I have new data that confirms the supply shortage is real. IMO 2021 will be spectacular. Not financial advice! #bitcoin $15K Best present on #Bitcoin whitepaper day! Recent rise in #bitcoin price and drop in gold price, increased the price of bitcoin to 7 ounces of gold. IMO this is significant. #bitcoin OK, we can forget this Paypal ""news"".  ""Crypto in [the Paypal]  account cannot be transferred to other accounts on or off PayPal.""  So, this is all a big PayPal nothing burger, just entries in a central PayPal database, nothing to do with #bitcoin #bitcoin priced in gold. Will this trend continue? #bitcoin$11k, final countdown  h/t  @BitcoinMemeHub   sound on! I like Adam's comparison of S2FX model to Moore's Law, an observation and a projection. What gives me even more confidence in S2FX: Moore's law is an EXTRApolation, but S2FX is an INTERpolation: we have data points beyond current #BTC range (silver, gold, diamonds, real estate). $10900 (Oct actual) $10778 (Sept close) $11655 (Aug close) $11356 (Jul close) $9132 (Jun close)  September red dot below August, bummer, but no worries. This also happened in January and March 2017. In fact, it marked 2017 #bitcoin phase transition Beautiful to see #bitcoin network effect keeping BTC on the same Stock2Flow-Value track as other monetary commodities like silver and gold. Just look at the data/chart, no model or math needed. #bitcoin mining: difficulty op +20% after halving .. like clockwork ""First I study this stuff, and I got introduced to stock to flow, and all in a sudden I am looking at PlanB [..] and then I start doing the math [..] and then I realize [..] #bitcoin is doing the bidding of mother nature."" #Bitcoin relative strength index (RSI) almost 3 years <65. Do you think we will stay there forever .. or do we enter a >65 period next?  Why did $425M MSTR buy not move #bitcoin price up? Because they bought carefully, thousands of small incognito algo orders over a period of weeks. Key thing: $425M is transferred from weak hands (shitcoiners, traders, noobs) to strong hands (hodl): reducing future sell pressure #Bitcoin  #phase5 Do you think it is pure coincidence that bitcoin's historical S2F-MarketValue path (orange dots) aligns perfectly with Gold and Silver S2F-MarketValue (blue dots), or are we watching something more fundamental? #Bitcoin is a fast growing country in cyberspace with a population of sovereign individuals who prefer to use BTC for storing wealth and doing transactions: - population 3M (#134 largest of the world) - monetary base $200B (#21 largest globally) Small #bitcoin test to shake out weak hands that entered May-Aug. If you can't handle this, get out now. If you can, welcome to the club! Things to watch: - will this be the first dip that stays above $10K - will we see a fast V-shape recovery next days Reminder: we are still early, only 4 months after #bitcoin 2020 halving, nicely between 2012 and 2016 paths. Patience is a virtue. $11880 (Sept actual)  $11655 (Aug close) $11356 (July close) $9132 (June close)  #Bitcoin .. like clockwork Do you think #bitcoin will reach $500K, $288K (S2FX model) or $100K (S2Fv2 model) before December 2021 .. or will BTC stay below $100K? #bitcoin Fiat currency Proof-of-Work    vs          #bitcoin PoW Straight line up to $1trillion market cap! #bitcoin going for gold next ($10T) #bitcoin $50K Wow 55K votes! This poll indicates BTC price is extremely undervalued now: 40% x $288K + 45% x $100K + 8% x $55K = $165K  #bitcoin looking strong .. RSI 90 #bitcoin on track for $100K between April and September BREAKING ... I quit my job (PlanA) and start focusing on #bitcoin (PlanB) full time as of March 1st!  #bitcoin phase5 #bitcoin price track after 2020 halving is between 2012 and 2016 tracks. I added S2F ($100K) and S2FX ($288K) model targets. Targets are average prices, actual BTC price will oscillate around targets. If 2021 bull market follows 2017 then $100K it is, if we follow 2013 .. $288K #bitcoin looking strong .. RSI 88 .. 95 next? #bitcoin  zooming in on $1T market cap .. S2FX model line $5T next #bitcoin / S&P500 to cross the line again?  S&P-implied BTC price = $60K $GME short squeeze shows the power of HODL. Imagine what we can do with #bitcoin. You ain't seen nothing yet. Short squeeze QE  Don't sell, never sell, just HODL  Get your BTC off exchanges and in your own wallet (because then nobody can use your bitcoin for short selling) If history is any guidance and #bitcoin continues it's current trajectory, BTC could be $100K somewhere between April and September ""#bitcoin is not volatile to an investor with a 4 year time frame"" @michael_saylor Faketoshi's attack on #bitcoin with patents & copyrights underlines the importance of bitcoin being P2P: a central authority (server, data center, company, CEO etc) is vulnerable for attacks by patent trolls, fraudsters, scammers, States. If not done already, read the whitepaper! #bitcoin is just warming up for next  If you really think Tether bullshit and Mt.Gox FUD is bigger than QE / central bank money printing, then you are doing it wrong; sell your BTC to Grayscale, Paypal, Cashapp, UHWNI's and hedge funds, and get out of the game. Correction, or no correction, that is the question. 2013 correction when the US government cracked down on Mt.Gox and seized accounts. 2017 corrections after Bitfinex hack, SEC ETF denial and BCH fork. Today Grayscale, Paypal, Cashapp each buy more BTC every day than are mined. #bitcoin is 22 ounces of gold .. and rising #bitcoin 200WMA increasing 10% per month #Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow model on track .. like clockwork #bitcoin floor is increasing faster and faster #bitcoin priced in gold (no USD, no QE) .. the trend continues #bitcoin solved the Byzantine generals problem. This solution can not be undone it is here to stay. Some ignorati still spread tulip bubble FUD, tether FUD, it-has-no-value FUD. But more and more people understand the magnitude of bitcoin's invention, and the impact on humanity #bitcoin currently in between 2013 and 2017 tracks The #bitcoin shortage is real #bitcoin monthly RSI is not even 95. In 2011, 2013 and 2017 bull markets we had at least 3 months above 95. Still early. #bitcoin market cap is larger than $1trillion, and we are only 10 months into this halving cycle. Where do you think the yellow, green, blue dots next 30 months will be? Hint: look at clusters 2016-2020 (S2F ~25) and 2012-2016 (S2F ~10). #bitcoin stock-to-flow model on BTC valued in gold: like clockwork. No dollar supply estimate needed. No QE effects. Indeed no US dollar. Important message indeed: 67% of all energy produced is lost. #bitcoin mining primarily uses this waste energy. Energy concerns about bitcoin mining are mostly plain wrong. https://journal.bitcoinreserve.com/bitcoin-a-bold-american-future/… #Bitcoin looking strong! IMO we will see RSI > 95 and we will stay at that level for a couple of months (like 2017, 2013 and 2011) If you did not buy #bitcoin last month, because you thought BTC was too expensive at $50K .. then you already missed out on +20% return. December close: $28,992 January close: $33,141 February close: $45,240 March 17 price: $55,000 We are only 3.5 months into the #bitcoin bull market. IMO BTC will not stop at $100K and will continue to S2FX $288K average price level (ATH will be higher). #bitcoin like clockwork #bitcoin #bitcoin phase5 .. moving towards S2F model line .. fast Some misunderstanding about #bitcoin relative strength index (RSI). This chart shows 200WMA and RSI (basically a moving average, but indexed at 0-100). Note that in 2013 the high RSI (orange/red) period was 10 months and in 2017 8 months. We are now in month 4: bull just started. #bitcoin went from $10K in Oct to $50K in Feb. Do you realize that if we do that same 5x in 5 months, then BTC is $250K in July  #bitcoin RSI 91 .. pausing for 95? my most hated chart .. about #bitcoin / S&P500 correlation .. S&P $4K and BTC $100K soon? #bitcoin 200 week moving average going vertical #Bitcoin is looking strong at RSI 92. Still not above RSI 95 like 2017, 2013 and 2011 bull markets. I calculated BTC price needed for RSI 95 at April close: $92K. Let's see what the Coinbase IPO will do today #bitcoin: Number-go-Up technology #bitcoin mempool is clearing! 4-5sat/byte fee transactions being processed. Great time to reorg wallets before the next big jump in price.  https://mempool.space/graphs#1m ""Caruso, one of the largest and most admired privately held real estate companies in the United States, [..] has made a significant initial investment in bitcoin as part of its treasury management strategy"" #Bitcoin has been stuck around $55K since Feb 19. I guess we need some consolidation around this magical number: weak hand giving their coins to strong hands. Long term trend (200 week moving average) does not care, goes up every day. Now that all Pi-cycle, Wave, Rainbow and NUPL fans have sold their bitcoin, it is probably time for institutions to resume buying into Q2. US Dollar has lost 99.99% in value last 10 years (against bitcoin) .. probably nothing Cancelled my sailing holiday to Turkey. If this is how Turkey government treats property rights and steals from its own citizens, I can only imagine how Turkey government treats tourists (especially tourists that own BTC! airport checks etc). Brains and capital will leave Turkey. Roger Ver -> BCH Mark Zuckerberg -> Libra Calvin Ayre -> BSV Elon Musk -> Doge All trying to create ""the next bitcoin"", bitcoin 2.0, their own coin. Have they not learned? Why not build on #bitcoin help make BTC better? We know how this ends #networkeffect Net result (after Turkey ban, US tax FUD, Faketoshi law suits, Elon/Tesla energy FUD) is that bitcoin is 5x higher than ~6 months ago. And both S2FX model + onchain data indicate that we are only halfway this bull market. I would not be surprised to see another 5x next ~6 months. If Elon can be forced to ""change his mind"", then it is really important to know why. Why is proof-of-work crucial for bitcoin? Because a valid hash (PoW) is how P2P nodes know that a block is valid, without needing a server or trusted third party. Bitcoin is dead without PoW! We want ""all models to be broken"" and $100K BTC NOW. Truth is that it takes time. Some investors with 5X profits last couple of months, do not care about the Byzantine General problem or ECDSA, SHA256 or P2P, they trade numbers on the screen and take profit. Patience is a virtue. And .. #bitcoin is at $57,500 .. again. But the floor (200 week moving average and on-chain realized value) is rising fast. You never see a #bitcoin airdrop, giveaway scam etc. There is a reason for that. Can't wait to see the 2nd leg of this #bitcoin bull market If you - buy 1 btc @ $57K - sell 1 Mar2022 $80K call option @ $13K - buy 1 Mar2022 $60K put option @ $13K .. then your guaranteed return (apart from exchange risk) will be between 5%-40%. 5% when btc <$60K and 40% when btc >$80K Mar2022. No wonder Buffett & Munger hate #bitcoin Meet the bitcoin haters. They have their own shitshow conference, complete with a fake Satoshi, doomsday professors, sponsored by a billionaire with his own ""better/cheaper"" coin. Makes a nice block list.  #bitcoin realized cap (average cost price of all 18.7M BTC in existence today) is ~$23K. Every day BTC is above $23K, realized cap increases. In 2013 realized cap increased from <$10 to $300. In 2017 realized cap increased from $300 to $5000. At $23K we have some way to go IMO. I see my #bitcoin investment as a call option. I will either ride it to zero or $1million+, and sized my (initial) position accordingly. I am less interested in $100K-$288K, but focused on 2024 halving and beyond. I don't care about volatility, asymmetric return is key (0 vs 1M). In the chart you see at what price level each of the total 18.7M BTC was last moved.  So what happened in May? Weak hands sold ~1M BTC in May at $30k-35k .. which they bought in April at $55k-60k: a staggering ~$20B loss. The good news: these 1M #bitcoin are in strong hands now. Petrodollar is based on the use of highly polluting fossil fuels and needs to be replaced without delay. There is a clean solution: #bitcoin There is hope that humanity at the dawn of the 21st century will be remembered for having shouldered its responsibilities: #ExitPetrodollar We are back at Feb 8 open price of $39K, when Tesla made the bitcoin announcement. #FullCycle It's not your job to awaken all sheep. It is your job to awaken all the sleeping lions. #bitcoin OK moving on .. with current volatility, BTC at $44K and transaction volumes high, #bitcoin momentum (200 Week Moving Average and Realized Value) is still up and onward. If you want to make a statement, selling your Tesla stock and buying #bitcoin instead could be very effective IMO. getrawtransaction 54e48e5f5c656b26c3bca14a8c95aa583d07ebe84dde3b7dd4a78f4e4186e713 0 00000000000000ecbbff6bafb7efa2f7df05b227d5c73dca8f2635af32a2e949 | sed 's/0100000000000000/\n/g' | tail -n +2 | cut -c7-136,139-268,271-400 | tr -d '\n' | cut -c17-368600 | xxd -p -r >bitcoin.pdf #bitcoin: short term volatile, long term trending up Long overdue: #bitcoin +20% daily return (last: July & Dec 2017) Even for me it is always a bit uneasy when bitcoin price is at the lower bound of the stock-to-flow model. Will it hold (like Mar 2019 when I published S2F, or Mar 2020 Covid, or Sep 2020 with BTC stuck at $10K) and is this another buying opportunity? Or will S2F be invalidated? What a difference 3 months make!   41% now thinks bitcoin will stay below $100K in 2021 (invalidating S2F model) vs 16% in March (when BTC was $55K). Do you think #bitcoin will reach $500K, $288K (S2FX model), $100K (S2F model), or will BTC stay below $100K .. before December 2021? Paul Tudor Jones: ""I like bitcoin. #Bitcoin is math"" $288K still in play. It would really surprise me if #bitcoin would not touch the black S2FX model line this phase. Regardless of current volatility, yellow green and blue dots will be (much) higher than red orange dots. The good news: #bitcoin is now formally an asset class. It can not be banned or ""criminalized"".  More good news: this proposal (which has to be converted in capital directives and in local bank law) was written before El Salvador made BTC legal tender. BTC is now just another FX. Replying to  @MitchKlee_  and  @GaryLeland #bitcoin .. up and onward #Bitcoin at $46K. We are 16 months after the halving (red line), awaiting the second leg of this bull market. I get messages from people asking if the current 51% attack on BSV coin could also happen to #bitcoin ...  That is NOT the case! BTC hashrate (~100EH/s) is 1000X higher than BSV (~0.1EH/s). See chart: orange line bottom right near X-axis is BSV (forked in 2018), blue line is BTC. #bitcoin July closing price $41,490 ... it bounced from the lows, like clockwork A short story about risk and return (#bitcoin, Gold, S&P) Nobody who bought #bitcoin and hodled 4+ years (200 weeks) lost money, EVER!   Also, both 200wma and realized cap (average cost price of all 18.8M BTC) are at all time high (ATH). Current decline and fall of capitalism, extreme central bank money printing (QE / debasement), war on covid, rise of fascism, and the emergenge of bitcoin as sound money are not unrelated. L'histoire se répète. S2F model: BTC=a*(S2F ratio)^b Time model: BTC=a*(months from Jan09)^b  Why I prefer S2F model: - tells you when price increases: after halvings - more robust parameters (a,b) - time not an input variable, S2FX not a time series - interpolation possible - usable with other assets Both #bitcoin S2F (white line) and on-chain signal (color, not red yet) still indicating a 2nd leg of this bull market. #Bitcoin = NgU technology Do you think #bitcoin will reach $500K, $288K (S2FX model), $100K (S2F model), or will BTC stay below $100K .. before December 2021? So what will #bitcoin Dec closing price be? - S2F model says $100K - Time model (logarithmic regression) says $30K Next couple of months will be Interesting. My money is on S2F, of course. So first a Chinese virus with 0.15% IFR brings down all Western economies, values and freedoms.  Then Evergrande, China's largest real estate developer collapses, prossibly bringing down China's economy.  Coincidence?  Note: #bitcoin Feb 2020 closing price (before covid): $8.5K China's Lehman moment. The money printing will be massive, I repeat MASSIVE! This is good for #bitcoin Let's get USD, M2 and QE out of the equation! #bitcoin = 26 ounces of gold .. and rising ""There is #bitcoin and there is shitcoin"" ... This is why I tweet about bitcoin and covid. Bitcoin is about financial freedom, covid about personal freedom. There is no financial freedom without personal freedom. Governments will connect central bank digital currencies (CBDC) to vaccine passports! This is phase5, it is war. This was Jan 2019 (btc 3.5k), still very true today. Bitcoin beats stock (and gold, and real estate) in risk adjusted return (that means: bitcoin is more risky, but you invest less, to level the risk with other investments, and still have more return). Funny to see all ""sell the news"" traders handing over their bitcoins to El Salvador and Hodlers around the world. Make sure you transfer your btc out of the exchanges and into your own wallet! #Bitcoin August closing price $47,156 .. like clockwork Imagine selling BTC now #bitcoin bull market, 2nd leg has started #bitcoin looking strong: RSI>70 and in ATH mode (red) Forget USD, #Bitcoin = 31 ounces of Gold .. and rising #bitcoin relative strength index (RSI) > 70  #bitcoin ATH=$58.8K (monthly close). BTC now: $56.5K #bitcoin monthly RSI is 66. In other markets RSI is between 30 and 70. But with bitcoin it is different: RSI in range 45-100. So what's next, green bottom (a la 2014 and 2018) or green top (a la 2011)? One thing is sure, this cycle is different. Do you think #bitcoin will reach $500K, $288K (S2FX model), $100K (S2F model), or will BTC stay below $100K .. by Christmas 2021?

Just looking to get rid of my fiat.   #Bitcoin $XRP $DOGE will help Bitcoin. #Bitcoin Clubhouse rooms are hilarious right now.   The rebellion?  “we must destroy DOGE!”. #Bitcoin is our SOV (digit gold) and $DOGE is used for transactions.   Where’s the problem? #Bitcoin and $DOGE can co-exist.   Crazy to see this war going on. I’m laughing. The #Bitcoin Maxi’s are holding press conferences to announce that Tom Brady changed his profile picture to include laser eyes.   I’ll take Elon Musk and Mark Cuban.   Get ready SpaceX. FULL SEND DOGE DOGE family- don’t feel threatened by these Bitcoin Maxi’s. Fun facts. Most people who own DOGE also own $BTC and other digital assets. $DOGE is bringing in so many new people into this space.   Besides bringing them into this space, the community is literally helping them understand what cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is.   Meaning : They also have brought themselves $ETH or $BTC.   #DogecoinToTheMoon I send $1,000 in $BTC to your wallet. What are you buying?   #cryptocurrencies Replying to  @elonmusk If you’re wishing for #Bitcoin to die, you’re not really crypto.   You can dislike the cult and the tribalism, but everything is still attached to it.   Pray for a recovery.  They tried to scare you out of your positions.   Shout out to the diamond hands!   #Bitcoin You just sold your #Bitcoin and $ETH to every single institution and corporation.   Great job. So now #Bitcoin Maxi’s are drawing line in the sand and are coming together to short $TSLA.   Good luck with that. Y’all are crazy if you think Elon caused the drop today.   #Bitcoin dip was coming regardless. I’m getting DM’s for me to reply to this madness.   It’s simple - DOGE isn’t a threat to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is digital gold at this current time and DOGE is a “brand” that can be and is being used to transact with.   They can both co-exist.   cryptocurrency is a space for every1. Replying to  @elonmusk  and  @itsALLrisky Congrats to Paraguay !  And congratulations to  @carlitosrejala  for pushing to make this happen.   #Bitcoin El Salvador #Bitcoin bill has officially passed. El Salvador voted to officially make #Bitcoin legal tender. Now we’ll go from blaming Elon to Trump for the dip and not understand that the #Bitcoin elites are dumping and forcing you to sell to buy your sh*t. I hope $ETH flips $BTC. Elon, let’s not talk about #Bitcoin anymore.   Focus on $DOGE. All the banks are coming into the #cryptocurrency and buying #Bitcoin and $ETH — but telling y’all to get out. I HOPE ALL YOU SHORTS GOT COMPLETELY REKT!   #Bitcoin This is shocking!   You knew this was coming. #Bitcoin $AMC — accept $DOGE because no one is going to spend their $BTC to go to a movie.   And people actually want to spent their $DOGE. Right now it’s $BTC and $ETH.   The ALTS haven’t even started . October is going to be a monster month for #bitcoin and the rest of the #crypto space.     Send It All! If $SHIB or $FLOKI are bringing new people into this space, what’s the problem?   These are the same people who will learn that you can get a #bitcoin at a fraction in a non-toxic environment. I want to talk about $VET and $DOT.   I want to talk about $BTC and $ETH.   But $SHIB getting into the top 10 is news.   It’s an amazing feat.  I didn’t think getting a bag of $SHIB would cause so much drama in the $DOGE community.   I have $BTC and $ETH as well.   Tribalism is the worst man. ALTs are going to go absolutely crazy once #bitcoin cools down.   This is NFA.   Research this!!  Mark Cuban saying that people would rather use $DOGE over $BTC to buy stuff is right.  I am NOT going to $AMC and spending my #bitcoin when everyone is screaming “stack sats”, “hold the line”, and that “#bitcoin is going to $1,000,000.” @mcuban , you nailed it. BREAKING: #Bitcoin Futures ETF from Valkyrie has officially been approved.  #BitcoinETF $SHIB Gets More Mentions on Twitter Than #Bitcoin, #Ethereum, $DOGE https://u.today/shib-gets-more-mentions-on-twitter-than-bitcoin-ethereum-doge…  This is good for the space. As long as we can keep bringing more people here it’s all good. And whether you like it or not — $SHIB would have made you this amount and you could have done whatever you wanted with it.   Put it into $BTC or $ETH. If the rumors of the SEC approving a #Bitcoin ETF are true, all I got to say is get ready.  Breaking: Gary Gensler says the SEC has NO plans to ban #bitcoin  or #cryptocurrency. Rumor : #bitcoin set to become legal tender in Brazil .  Two countries….. Iran lifts its ban on #bitcoin mining.    send I have to send someone $500 — it’ll be on $BTC or $ETH. ",INTJ,0.0430
 TheCryptoLark,"#bitcoin is inevitable, all who have gone against it are now being forced to kneel, first JPMorgan, now Goldman Sachs. Banks made 10 Billion off of being the middleman for the Federal loan program for small businesses. The banks assumed no risk, had to do almost no work, and the tax payers foot the bill. Disgusting.  #bitcoin #crypto #bitcoin went from 12k to 20k within the space of a few days in 2017 with fewer fiat on ramps, 1/10 of the stablecoin cap, and tiny handful of working #crypto products. The 2020/2021 bull market will be INSANE In the last bull run #bitcoin had multiple pullbacks of 30-40% to test the 200 day moving average. Selling your $btc now on a 13% pullback is like selling on the red circle on this chart. Insane gains are coming, don't get shaken out. There is not enough #bitcoin for each paypal user to have 0.05 $btc - let that sink in No one knows when, but gravity will catch up with #bitcoin and alts will go insane Paypal and Cashapp combined are buying more than all the newly produced #bitcoin. Grayscale is buying more than both of them combined.   What does that mean? Moon The world's second biggest bank is selling 3 billion dollars worth of bonds in exchange for #bitcoin!!! Unreal man.... Square sold two times more #bitcoin than was produced in Q3! Add in Grayscale and now Paypal and there is a serious supply crisis coming. Moon soon. Grayscale bought 16,000 #bitcoin last week.  Miners created 6,300.   Grayscale bought 2.5X more $btc than was produced!  INSANE SCARCITY coming into effect!  Moooonnnnnnn!!!! People already buying #bitcoin on Paypal! 346 million customers. Good night bears, see you next time. Over a billion worth of #bitcoin moved for $3! Moving that much gold would require armed guards and a chartered jet and take days! Classic #crypto day with people panic selling alts for massive losses to fomo into a 2% #bitcoin move Remember 2 days ago when JP Morgan was caught rigging #gold markets for 8 years and their CEO didn't go to jail? Yeah, but let's throw the book at Bitmex because something something #bitcoin Grayscale just bought another 17,100 MORE #bitcoin! They now own 2.5% of the entire supply! They will soon enough own 5% then 10%. Stack those sats friends, get yours before Grayscale does! #bitcoin has now closed above $10,000 for 63 days in a row, the longest run its history. Any dips under 10k were aggressively bought. Halving effects starting to be felt.    This 37% drop happened to #bitcoin back in January 2017, weak hands capitulated. Those who bough that dip went into the hall of fame. You have a choice right now in the market, what are you doing? If you loved #bitcoin at $58,000 then you must REALLY love it at $45,000!!! Fundamentals haven't changed since last week If you believe that #bitcoin is going to $100,000+ and that #ethereum is going to $10,000+ as I do then this market correction is a gift. Demand is already far surpassing the ability of miners to produce #bitcoin, and demand is rising exponentially. The likelihood that we are entering a super cycle for the asset class is very likely. The 4 year cycle theory may no longer apply. Miami has just become a #bitcoin town! Taxes, fees, employees can all paid in BTC! They may even add BTC to the city treasury! What if the #bitcoin 4 year cycle gets broken and we just have a ten year straight bull run for #crypto starting now... let us whisper of this dream All that $doge coin trolling and the whole time Elon as stacking #bitcoin, savage, love it Holy cow!!! It's official! Tesla bought 1.5 billion worth of #bitcoin!!! Coinbase reaches a record high ranking in the App Store. Retail fomo tsunami. Remember only 25% of CB users are #bitcoin only invests, 75% buy #altcoins. Prepare yourself. Grayscale bought more than 8,000 #bitcoin yesterday, if they did that every day then they would buy 2.9 million BTC this year. There are only 2 million on exchanges. There is no scenario where with this insane demand that the price is not going to go much higher. 6 Days ago Guggenheim said #bitcoin run is done, time to sell, today they are saying they are targeting $400,000 per $btc... I'm sure they appreciate all the panic sellers who let them buy around 30k last week. If you want to 5X your wealth then buy #bitcoin, if you want to 100X your wealth buy #altcoins. After #bitcoin cracked $40,000 it had a brutal 10% crash to prices not seen since early this morning.... A Norwegian billionaire... Last Week: Ban Bitcoin This Week: Buys 58 million worth   Life is comedy Brazil has approved a #bitcoin ETF, the USA is comically behind at this point! Well done Brazil. Everything is going according to plan! #bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of the year!!! This #bitcoin bull run has barely even started yet! We are just now past the first major price wave. Get ready for wave 2. #bitcoin miner selling has stopped for the first time since late December, today they switched back to holding. This is bullish for a price reversal. #bitcoin dominance has now fallen under a key area of support, get ready for the ultimate face melting altcoin season! This market will pump way higher than you can imagine, get ready! #bitcoin #crypto This little dip you are freaking out over will be totally irrelevant in 5 years when #bitcoin is at 500k. Fasten your seat belts! 50 day MA loss confirmed. Average period of pain is around 12 days. #bitcoin In 2017 #bitcoin dipped under the 50 day MA 6 times (green arrows), and had sustained drops under the 50 day MA 4 times which lasted on average for 12 days.   We are currently seeing the literal first dip under the 50 MA for this entire bull run! #bitcoin is going to 6 digits this year! For anyone who needs to hear this, the bull run is not over! These kind of corrections are actually really healthy to shake out the greedy and help create a sustainable bul run! #bitcoin #crypto #bitcoin does not derive its value from Tesla or Elon. And let's keep it real, almost no one was going to use BTC to buy a car anyway. I just bought some more #bitcoin, thanks Elon! 2021 is fun, but just imagine where this industry will be in 2031! Those playing the long game will succeed beyond their wildest dreams. #bitcoin #ethereum #crypto #bitcoin dominance now under 50%! Wow! #altcoins getting ready for a mega pump! Most #crypto coins are insanely speculative and profits should be taken aggressively on them.   #bitcoin is a long term wealth asset, I will likely never sell   #ethereum is a long term passive income beast, I will likely never sell If you can’t handle the dumps then you don’t deserve the pumps! #bitcoin #crypto The market is hilarious! A few weeks ago people would sell their grandma to buy at these prices, and now that those prices have come not many are brave enough to click buy! #bitcoin #ethereum #crypto Carl Icahn's Icahn Capital will be buying a billion to a billion and a half dollars worth of #bitcoin and #ethereum Big week for famous investors entering #bitcoin, first Ray Dalio admitted to owning BTC, now Carl Icahn says he is going to get in! This is the lowest fear reading since March 2020! #bitcoin In the last week - Elon FUD - China FUD - Binance FUD  - OCC FUD  All at the same time.   There is a coordinated effort to shake you out.   #bitcoin Imagine thinking the bear market has come before #ethereum moves to proof of stake, before Polka $dot parachains, before #cardano smart contracts, and before a #bitcoin ETF!!! #bitcoin is a 6 digit asset which is currently trading under 50k! Ok Elon confirmed that Tesla did not sell their #bitcoin, can we get back to the bull market now please! A day will come when the bull market will end and you should not buy the dip.   Today is not that day.   #bitcoin #ethereum #crypto The Tesla #Bitcoin is worth about 0.2% of the entire market cap. So around 38k BTC after selling 10% previously. In the last 30 days institutions have bought 215,000 BTC. Tesla does not make this market. This #bitcoin ranging consolidation period is the ""boring"" prelude to the BTC ETF approval pump mania phase. #bitcoin to 6 digits #ethereum to 5 digits  Your low cap alts to the moon #bitcoin under 100k is cheap! Puell Multiple flashing a big buy signal for #bitcoin! Only the 5th time ever! Last 4 times were spot on, will this one be too? The #bitcoin ETF in Brazil has begun trading! If this was our Wyckoff spring moment then July could be very exciting! #bitcoin This FUD too shall pass! #bitcoin Get rich quickers mostly get broke quick, whereas long term investors most get rich slowly, albeit exponentially faster than any other investment class! #bitcoin #ethereum #crypto Paraguay will be introducing #bitcoin legislation in July! If you are pissing off both the IMF and the World bank then you are probably doing something right!   #ElSalvador #bitcoin I am actually surprised that there is any office furniture left at the Microstrategy offices. Could just sell it all and buy #bitcoin! The second half of 2021 is going to melt faces! #bitcoin #crypto Mexican politicians now looking into #bitcoin as well!!! Whoa!!! Panama now talking about adopting #bitcoin too after the announcement by El Salvador! Country level #bitcoin fomo is starting! Bottom is in or near, never trust JP Morgan!  Bye banks, buy #bitcoin Let me translate this news article for you.   Blackrock wants to buy up a significant amount of #bitcoin, they would prefer you ignore it until they are ready to pump the prices sky high. THEN they will tell you to buy it. Classic. #bitcoin bill being presented today in Paraguay! In the not so distant future Twitter will be filled with people posting I wish I had bought #bitcoin when it was cheaper! Later in July, starting from the 13th Grayscale will begin the unlock of around 41,000 #bitcoin worth of GBTC shares. But WTF does this actually mean and should you be worried.   You need to read this thread!  Barclay's just wants to keep you safe, this is why they let you spend your life savings on the lottery, at the casino, or trading stock futures. But buying #bitcoin on Binance is a bridge to far.   PS they are a huge criminal money launderer Pump it!!! #bitcoin In June China carried out the biggest #bitcoin crackdown in history. And nothing broke. Bitcoing just kept on bitcoining. Paypal getting ready for the next round of the bull market! #bitcoin If you know, you know ;)   #bitcoin #bitcoin LOL, WTF just happened to #bitcoin! Almost hit 40k!!!! Bears in total disbelief at this point Oooohhhh..... #bitcoin just reclaimed the 50 day moving average! Nice! Hello #bitcoin!!! Pump it! Elon Musk owns #bitcoin, #ethereum and #dogecoin! His companies Tesla and SpaceX both hold BTC on their balance sheets! Uhhhh, guys, are you seeing this?  First JP Morgan said that #bitcoin is a popular asset to invest in, now CNBC is saying that BTC mining isn't actually that bad for the environment.   Media flow can flip real bullish real quick Black Rock says #bitcoin has no demand  Goldman Sachs Says Bitcoin is not a viable investment  Guggenheim says BTC going to 10k  JP Morgan says BTC going to 25k  The biggest manipulators in the world are bearish on BTC!   What will you do? From what I am seeing in the markets right now the end of the year is going to be INSANE!!! #bitcoin #crypto It is INSANE how bullish the market is in spite of this regulatory FUD hanging over the market! #bitcoin #crypto OMG the market is insanely bullish right now! #bitcoin is exploding You can literally just buy #bitcoin and #ethereum and nothing else and you will still absolutely slay it in the coming years! Uruguay is the next country looking to legislate #bitcoin and to allow for payments! This would be huge if it gets passed! #bitcoin In 2019 Well Fargo banned retail customers from buying #bitcoin, now they sell BTC to their rich clients only. LOL #Bitcoin just closed the weekly candle above a line of key resistance, and above the 21 week EMA! Big bank buys a quarter billion dollars worth of #bitcoin (GBTC), wow! #bitcoin just hit $50,000 for the first time since May! Last time the hash ribbons gave a strong buy signal resulted in a 250% gain for #bitcoin, will history repeat? If so 100K BTC coming to a life near you. Accept the power of Uptober into your life! #bitcoin September is over, this is usually a bad month for #bitcoin, welcome to uptober! A CME futures backed #bitcoin ETF is how Wall Street tries to control the price of BTC, this is how the SEC “protects” investors Canada once again innovating in the #crypto ETF space with the launch of a #bitcoin #ethereum ETF. USA is sooooo behind it is laughable at this point By the end of the decade #bitcoin will be at a minimum of $500,000 IMO, likely higher. It is gold 2.0, and it is still in price discovery. Well crap… Jamie is finally bullish on #bitcoin Whales bought the China FUD, adding 80,000 #bitcoin to their fat stacks. If this is your first China #bitcoin #crypto ban then understand  1 China has been trying and failing since 2013 2 no one can shut crypto down 3 China bans all the cool stuff, just makes it cooler 4 this too shall pass  5 this dip will be slurped deeply by those in the know Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful! #bitcoin #crypto #bitcoin dumping again, China must be double banning it today, lol #bitcoin was around $700 in 2013 when China first banned it. At some point you think they would figure out trying to ban it just isn’t working lol Twitter has 350 million monthly active users, all of those people can now send #bitcoin to each other! This is HUGE for adoption! #bitcoin 4 year cycles still playing out.  2013 and 2017 saw a peak sell off in July, big sell off in September, and massive rallies in Q4.  Probably just a coincidence right? Looks like EverGrande is going to make its bond payment this month. Bull run back on baby! #bitcoin #bitcoin has entered extreme fear #bitcoin still going to 100k this year, Q4 2013 and Q4 2017 both saw 300% + rallies.  What would make BTC do that again?   A BTC ETF getting approved in the USA. #bitcoin was $10,000 a year ago today I still believe that Q4 will be very bullish for #crypto and that #bitcoin will hit 100k by EOY. I also believe most will get totally caught up in the euphoria and hand most of their paper gains back to the market. Don't let that be you! In both 2013 and 2017 #bitcoin rallied by over 300% in Q4. Getting ready for a repeat IMO. #bitcoin golden cross will probably confirm tomorrow US investors get so screwed in #crypto  - No token sales  - SEC trying to crush lending  - Infrastructure bill attacking staking  - Airdrops limited - BTC ETF futures backed, lol - Limited leverage options  - Accredited investor laws  Seems like they are trying to keep you poor El Salvador has now bought 550 #bitcoin, yes, a country is buying BTC directly! El Salvador has officially started buying #bitcoin as part of its plan to roll out BTC as legal tender this week! When will the bull market end? How will you know?  #bitcoin #ethereum #crypto   thread Holy crap that is HUGE!!! #bitcoin #ethereum at $10,000 and #bitcoin at $100,000 just sound right, now all I need to do is wait for the market to make this into a reality. #ethereum 12% away from ATH #bitcoin 25% away from ATH The goal used to be to get 1 #bitcoin, but for most people that is just a dream now. Soon owning 1 #ethereum will also be out of reach. Tick tock... El Salvador now has 1,120 #bitcoin  A country, literally buying dips and stacking BTC Can we just change the name of #bitcoin to Bit Dog? It would surely pump then According to SEC filings Tesla may soon accept #bitcoin payments again! Do you think that #bitcoin is going to hit $100,000 in 2021? 3 #bitcoin ETFs approved in one week  The first #bitcoin ETF on US markets broke a billion in total assets on day 2!!!!!   The previous record holder (3 days) was gold  BTC is the new gold! #bitcoin highest daily candle close in history!!! #bitcoin highest weekly candle close ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #bitcoin will go to 500k to rival the market cap of gold, and it will then go onto a million dollars. Why, because Bitcoin, that’s why. You either get it and buy and hold… or you watch the train leave without you. SEC Approves Proshares #bitcoin ETF, it is official!  $60,000 #bitcoin is coming!!!! HUGE buy the rumor effect going on with #bitcoin ETF approval right now! More people in El Salvador have a #bitcoin wallet than a bank account. This is the future. Other countries are watching. JP Morgan says that big money prefers #bitcoin over gold, they also say that they prefer #ethereum over BTC.   So I guess it goes like this  #1 ETH #2 BTC #3 Gold   Do you agree? I don't think people are fully prepared for how insane the markets will go once we get a #bitcoin ETF approved! This year #bitcoin has been trash talked by famous economists, central bankers, the media, China, politicians, and many other misguided commentators.  BTC has proven them all wrong, as usual!  You guys remember when China banned #bitcoin a few weeks ago?  #bitcoin is only 15% from its all time high!  Step 1: #bitcoin ETF gets approved Step 2: #ethereum ETF gets approved Step 3: M O O N that spells moon #bitcoin over $54,000!!!!! This breaks the down trend and resistance at 53k.   Uptober is real!!!! Bull run phase 2 is heating up!  #bitcoin #crypto #bitcoin over 51k! A daily close here would be very bullish #bitcoin back at $50,000!!! #bitcoin going to 180 to 200k either in late Q4 or early Q1, when this happens your altcoin gains are going to be beyond what many of you can imagine. The US is 28.8 trillion dollars in debt...  There is now way this ever gets paid, the dollar is doomed.   Buy #bitcoin About 50% of people in El Salvador now have a #bitcoin wallet, only 30% have a bank account. BTC was able to give more people financial access in a better way in a month than the banking system could in 100 years. #bitcoin at 100k will seem so obvious in hindsight. Many will wish they could have bought under 50k Zuck is optmistic on #crypto and web 3.   Dude, just have FB buy a billion in #bitcoin already! The future of #crypto is SO obviously multi chain. Anyone telling you that only #bitcoin or only #ethereum will completely dominate is either deluded or not being honest. #bitcoin to get to a million is like 17X, I think we get there by the end of the decade.   However, a good #altcoin can give you a 17X in December...   Alts are for making gains, BTC for keeping them Will Plan B be proven right and #bitcoin will still hit $98,000 in November? #bitcoin exchange balances just keep falling. Smart money buys on red days. Dips are normal and healthy!  #bitcoin #crypto Having patience is like having a super power in this market. Most people are chasing over night riches, and rage sell every dip.   Remember, 3.4 billion more users are coming by the end of the decade. Numbers will go up  #bitcoin #crypto This week the CEO of Apple confirmed that he owns #bitcoin and #ethereum.   He joins Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey, Mark Cuban, and many more of the world's most intelligent and successful investors.   How is anyone still on the sidelines? WHAT???? This is insane!   Miami going to start paying out #bitcoin to residents as a dividend from the staking rewards made by Miami coin. Apple CEO owning #bitcoin and #ethereum is good social proofing which further normalises crypto Imagine owning 1 whole #bitcoin in the year 2030. You will be in a rare and elite class of investor Will Plan B and the stock to flow model be proven right and #bitcoin will pull a mega pump to 98k this month? ""How many millionaires do you know who have become wealthy by investing in savings accounts? I rest my case."" — Robert G. Allen  #bitcoin #crypto I love #bitcoin, but I couldn't imagine being in #crypto and only owning BTC!   The real money is being made in altcoins, BTC is the reserve asset #Bitcoin Balance on Exchanges is sitting at a 3 year low of 2,449,000 BTC!!!!   It is going to just keep going down.

 cameron,"Paul Tudor Jones isn't waiting around for approval from the establishment to buy bitcoin. And neither should you. Do your own research, build your own conviction, avoid groupthink. Hey Goldman Sachs, 2014 just called and asked for their talking points back.   Bitcoin was declared a commodity by the CFTC in 2015 in the Coinflip order...so yea it's an asset whose price is set by supply and demand. Just like gold. Just like oil. It's a commodity. By investing in Bitcoin, you are facilitating a peaceful transfer of power from governments to the people. ""NYTimes 09/Apr/2020 With $2.3T Injection, Fed’s Plan Far Exceeds 2008 Rescue"" -Bitcoin block 629,999 Wen BTC $10K? ""The problem with bitcoin is that it's too volatile..."" -Wall Street After today, oil  can no longer be considered a reliable store of value. Your next best options are the U.S. dollar (gulp), gold (scarce), or Bitcoin (fixed). When Buffett buys stake in gold mining company you know he knows something's up...inflation is coming. He'll find #Bitcoin in a decade. It took him until 2016 to find $APPL, but now it's his BIGGEST investment EVER at $95 billion, 44% of $BRK portfolio. 8 years ago I found #Bitcoin in Ibiza. Sometimes you find love when you least expect it. ATTENTION: #Bitcoin clean break of $12K! This is HUGE. #Bitcoin is going mainstream. Companies are starting to understand the importance of holding a fixed asset in their treasury. There will never be more than 21 million bitcoin. There's no bitcoin printer. Full stop. #Bitcoin is the greatest thing since sliced bread. There was a group standing around the first steam engine saying, “they’ll never get it started.” Once it started moving down the tracks, they said, “they’ll never get it stopped.” Dont be a pessimist. Optimists got to  build the railroads & today own #Bitcoin. Much more fun & $! Not owning #Bitcoin today will be a worse investment decision than not investing in $APPL, $GOOG, $AMZN, and $MSFT in the early 2000's. #Bitcoin offers the rare opportunity to do well and do good. By owning a piece of this network, you are promoting financial inclusion and a future where everyone can be their own bank, while also owning an asset (best performing of the past decade) that's headed to the moon. Bitcoin  Bitcoin is unstoppable. Bitcoin gave us the blueprint to decentralize the world. A trillion more reasons to own bitcoin. Every day is Independence Day in Bitcoin. There are no accounting frauds in Bitcoin. A lot of financial advisors and “experts” must be having hard conversations with their clients right now....on why they “advised” them not to buy #bitcoin LOL No, it's definitely NOT too late to invest in #Bitcoin #Bitcoin is not trying to destroy the existing system — its creating a new one. You don't have to buy #Bitcoin but the fact that you can buy an unpolluted digital store of value is a beautiful thing. Bitcoin wasn't built to finance wars, budget deficits, incompetence, etc. It doesn't fit inside the broken system. It's an entirely new system. Over the years many many people have told me that their financial advisor ""advised"" them to not buy #bitcoin $24K is a reminder that you should believe in yourself, build your own conviction, and don't let the ""experts"" distract you from your genius. Happy Saturday #Bitcoin The biggest risk when it comes to #Bitcoin is not investing in bitcoin. Today, #Bitcoin got the monkey off its back. It took three long, hard-fought years, but the $20K glass ceiling has been shattered. A turning point for our movement. With the wind at our backs, we continue our work to build a future w/ greater choice, independence, and opportunity There are 3.5 billion smart phones on the planet. All of them can hold bitcoin. None of them can hold gold. #Bitcoin is the future. BIG UPDATE:  @RayDalio , Founder of Bridgewater (world's largest hedge fund) just said in Reddit AMA: ""I think that #Bitcoin (and some other digital currencies) have over the last ten years established themselves as interesting gold-like asset alternatives."" https://old.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/k9b4g8/im_ray_daliofounder_of_bridgewater_associates_we/gf3i271/… I still get ask the question of how do you value #bitcoin even by highly sophisticated investors. The answer is super straightforward: supply and demand. That’s it. And we know the supply is fixed at 21million so it really comes down to demand. #Bitcoin is an emergent store of value that defends against inflation and has the potential to unseat gold. This means it could appreciate 25x in value from $19K. No other liquid asset in the universe can credibly offer this magnitude of asymmetric payoff in the next decade. At $18.5K #Bitcoin Google searches for ""bitcoin"" have not seen an uptick. This is not a FOMO rally. It's steady hands. Few understand this. I've said this before but it bears repeating. There are 46.8 million millionaires in the world. There are only 21 million #Bitcoin — less than half will ever be able to own 1 bitcoin. Don't miss the revolution. Very soon it will be irresponsible for companies not to hold #Bitcoin in treasury as a hedge to inflation #Bitcoin is knocking on $17K’s door. Happy Monday y’all! Thanks for flying with us today ladies and gentlemen. Off to the left you’ll see we’ve just passed $15K #Bitcoin and coming up on the right you’ll see $16K bitcoin. Please make sure to fasten your seatbelts as we begin our ascent to the moon. What's most interesting about #Bitcoin breaking $12K is that it also marks 87 days where the price has stayed above $10K. This is a record and shatters the previous 62-day streak in 2017... #Bitcoin is on its way to becoming a corporate treasury asset.  @michaelsaylor  and  @jack  are leading the charge. Soon many other companies will follow, and eventually central banks. This is just the beginning... #Bitcoin has been hovering around $10k for perhaps the longest stretch since inception. It's been pretty boring. That's a good thing. On this day in 2013, @tylerwinklevoss and I presented the long case for #Bitcoin at the Value Investing Congress in NYC. The price of bitcoin was $132.  Same conference where  @davidein  presented a short case for Lehman in 2007. Lehman filed for bankruptcy less than a year later. When #Bitcoin takes over Hong Kong. #Bitcoin and Ether are emergent money. They haven’t been forced upon anyone, their adoption is peaceful and organic. Fiat money is violent money, its adoption always requires force. The total amount of above-ground gold on earth fits into an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Physical assets are easier to control, seize, and censor. #Bitcoin lives everywhere and nowhere, its digital nature is one of its greatest strengths. #Bitcoin has made significant ground on gold — going from white paper to over $200 billion in market capitalization in under a decade. It will continue to cannibalize gold dramatically over the next decade. I don't normally like making definitive #bitcoin price predictions. That being said, this is the last time you're going to see bitcoin below $12K...until it goes back above $12K. If you are reading this, you are early to #Bitcoin. How do I know? Imagine thinking you were late to $AMZN in 2010. It was trading at $133. Yes, you missed $10 a decade before, but it will go on to hit $3500 for a 26x gain. Don't fixate on the past, focus on the future potential. The fact that there's a concept of after-hours trading in centralized finance really tells you all you need to know. #Bitcoin never sleeps. $TSLA had $19.4B cash (and equivalents) at the end of 2020, meaning its $1.5B #Bitcoin investment represented approx. 7.7% of its cash. S&P500 companies have $2.7 Trillion cash. If they invest similar percentage, would be $210B or 140x more. It's really just the beginning. If you are reading this, you are early to #Bitcoin. How do I know? Imagine thinking you were late to the world of publishing in 1500, ten years after Johannes Gutenberg invented the movable-type printing press. If you are reading this, you are early to #Bitcoin. How do I know? Imagine thinking you were late to aviation 10 years after the Wright brothers first flight in Kitty Hawk. Large-scale commercial aviation is still decades away and ppl are still crossing the Atlantic on steamers. First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then #Bitcoin breaks 57K. It's not every week that both a rover and #Bitcoin land on Mars First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you hit $1 Trillion dollar market cap. #Bitcoin BITCOIN IS NOW A TRILLION-DOLLAR ASSET The #Bitcoin white paper should be required high school reading. Full stop. We are firmly in the land of #Bitcoin  50K — onward and upward! We did it! #bitcoin broke 50K! An enormous and historical step towards the moon! Invest in #bitcoin   Three words that will change your life and the world Imagine owning Apple $APPL stock and not getting more shares in a share split. When the Fed prints more dollars, you don't get more dollars. Few understand this. #Bitcoin 50K #Bitcoin is one move away Dear #Bitcoin short-sellers,  Have fun getting blown out!  -Cameron PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT:   You don't have to buy an entire #Bitcoin   You can purchase as little as $5 on  @Gemini Conversation is quickly changing from why did you invest in #Bitcoin to why didn't you invest in bitcoin... If you are a company CEO and thinking about adding #Bitcoin to your balance sheet you still have the opportunity to be an early adopter. But not for long. . @elonmusk  and $TSLA adding $1.5B #Bitcoin to its balance sheet is both a visionary and responsible move. To the Mars! #Bitcoin is the hardest money in the observable universe. #DOGE is the funnest money in the observable universe. The need for both is obvious. Woof! #bitcoin gearing up to hit new highs . @Gemini  is UP. We have NOT disabled buying and selling of #bitcoin or any other cryptos. #bitcoin in bio Plot twist: #bitcoin is headed to Mars. #Bitcoin just hitched a ride on a Falcon 9 to the moon $GME Halted. #Bitcoin open. The modern money monopoly is over. #Bitcoin Yesterday will go down in history as the #Bitcoin “double-spend” dip 100 dollars today can buy what 2 dollars could buy in 1970. And it’s only going to get worse. #Bitcoin The supply of #Bitcoin does not increase with demand. It’s fixed. There’s nothing like it on our planet, in our galaxy, or in the universe. #Bitcoin and Ether $ETH have the potential to be timeless. Just like buying Amazon $AMZN in 1999 at its all-time high of $107 — if you held you would be up 29x at today's price. Filecoin $FIL and Zcash $ZEC are other projects to watch. Long Game. ""Small bull case scenario for #Bitcoin is...40,000 USD a coin, but I believe it could be much larger...it will probably happen much faster than anyone imagines."" -Me (2013)  https://mashable.com/2013/12/16/cameron-winklevoss-bitcoin/… #bitcoin getting ready to pounce on 40K #Bitcoin has closed the past 5 days above 30K, a truly remarkable record. $ETH was the best performing asset (up 450%) of 2020 hands down and still below its all-time high. Today it’s the equivalent of 15K #Bitcoin I would take that bet all day long We have entered an era where individual investors are as powerful and sophisticated as institutions. JP Morgan reports that retail investors purchased 187,00 #Bitcoin worth $10.4B in the past 3 months, while institutions purchased 173,000 $BTC worth $9.6B over the same period. Good morning #bitcoin 60K! #bitcoin brings scarcity to digital money. NFTs bring scarcity to digital art. To understand #bitcoin you must unlearn what you have learned about money. 1.9 trillion more reasons to own #Bitcoin ...then they fight you. HSBC is not only banning the purchase of #Bitcoin but also new purchases of MicroStrategy $MSTR. #Bitcoin is not an asset to be traded. It should be bought and HODLed. Few understand this. A single dose of #Bitcoin will give you immunity to inflation At $63K #Bitcoin it feels like we're running downhill towards $100K When Elon realizes that bitcoin mining is actually pushing the renewable energy industry forward, he will refresh position and #bitcoin will moon. People who don't invest in #Bitcoin should be prepared to lose all of their money due inflation. All central bankers know this. Few understand this. In the land of inflation, #bitcoin is king. BIG NEWS: welcome to #Bitcoin  @RayDalio ! Cash is trash. In the land of QE infinity, #bitcoin is king There are 46.8 million millionaires in the world. There are only 21 million #Bitcoin — less than half will ever be able to own 1 bitcoin. Don't miss the revolution. #Bitcoin is surging. What a day. Never lose the faith.

It's about exiting the system. Bitcoin is consumer protection from the Fed We need to get as many ppl into bitcoin as possible before hyperinflation. This is a moral imperative, not an investment thesis. No thanks. I'd rather Build Back with #Bitcoin Inflation isn't coming, it's here. And it's not ""transitory"" but rather has topped 5% for 5 months straight and is increasing at the fastest rate in 30 years. #Bitcoin fixes this.

JUST BUY! When #Bitcoin crashes 50%, there are no bailouts, but still mainstream finance is quick to label it a Ponzi scheme.  When traditional markets crash 50%, mainstream finance begs the FED to print trillions of dollars and bail them out.  Think twice which one is the Ponzi. The next Bitcoin halving is coming soon, and it will lead to the next bull cycle to $1,000,000. It’s better to buy #Bitcoin under $50k than to FOMO in at $70k!

Everyone’s been waiting to see it $ETH could flip $BTC but the true flippening was $SHIB flipping $DOGE!

 WClementeIII,"CNBC Anchor talking Stock-Flow and Logarithmic charts... mainstream understanding is beginning They can’t call them tulips anymore! #Bitcoin  @PrestonPysh   @100trillionUSD   @Croesus_BTC #Bitcoin Supply-Shock Incoming. Miners ramped up selling between $27k-$32k, but since have completely stopped selling their #Bitcoin   This is either due to their ability to finance operations through debt or they know something... Since Bitcoin crossed All-Time-Highs in December, the amount of #Bitcoin on Coinbase has fallen off a cliff.   Now -188,820 BTC ($10.66B) since ATH. 215,331 #Bitcoin ($10.9 Billion) moved to Illiquid Addresses (Strong-hands) yesterday.   You're a fool to be selling right now. A record amount of #Bitcoin Options expire this Friday. ($6B)  Previous record was at the end of January ($4B), price went up 80% after. Yes, this #Bitcoin cycle is different. It boils down to Supply/Demand.   In 2017, there was a steady increase of BTC on exchanges along with price, while in the current run-up we've seen a dramatic decrease in BTC on exchanges, inverse to price. Based on HODL Waves, this #Bitcoin Bull Run is equivalent to $4,000 in 2017.   This would entail another 5x, or roughly $300,000 peak. Anyone who has EVER bought #Bitcoin is in Profit.  RIP Bears. For all my “#Bitcoin mining boils oceans” people out there: Microstrategy is up $3,578,716,599 on their #Bitcoin position.  In the last 15 years, they've generated $747M in net income.  They've generated 4.79x their total net income from the last 15 years, in less than a year, simply by buying Bitcoin. #Bitcoin Supply Shortage is massive:  - 15,680 BTC in the last 24 hours - 23,970 BTC in the last week - 61,555 BTC in the last month - 568,618 BTC in the last year This #Bitcoin Bull Run is still far from overheated on multiple on-chain indicators.   In comparison to 2017, it appears we're around the $3k-5k range. Bitcoin doesn't need Facebook, Facebook needs #Bitcoin 78.3% of #Bitcoin supply is either lost or held by wallets that have no history of selling.  This is what conviction paired with absolute scarcity looks like. Anyone bearish on #Bitcoin is not taking into account the number of new users coming onto the network.   Currently over 60,000 new users a day.   Each cycle goes through a parabolic phase of new adoption, we are currently in that phase of this cycle. Long-Term Holders are not selling their #Bitcoin. Clearly a trend now. Would seriously like to know why #bitcoin price dumps at the end of every month. Clearly a pattern at this point.  And more importantly, will the coming weeks follow suit? 46.8M millionaires in the world.  Only 21M #Bitcoin.  Only 2.37M coins available to buy on exchanges.  Run the Numbers. - 10% of supply hasn't moved in 10 years - 18% of supply hasn't moved in 7 years  - 35% of supply hasn't moved in 3 years - 45% of supply hasn't moved in 2 years - 55% of supply hasn't moved in 1 year  #Bitcoin draws in more HODLers with conviction over time. Every major indicator is resetting, giving #bitcoin price a lot of room to run.   I don’t think people realize how aggressive this next leg up will be, FOMO will be intense. $6K to $60K is the same percentage increase as $60K to $600K. #Bitcoin #Bitcoin 19,259 BTC moved onto exchanges before Elon's tweet. This would be quite a coincidence. $32M of #bitcoin liquidations in 10 minutes. Supply held by Addresses with 100-1,000 #BTC hasn't gone vertical like this since 2013. Wow, a massive batch of 7,200 #BTC ($420M) was moved off exchanges this morning. Buying #Bitcoin in 2020/2021 offers you the most asymmetrical Risk/Reward profile the asset has ever had.   You get to buy battle hardened, de-risked, network effect beyond the point of no return BTC with incredible upside still to come. Long-term #bitcoin holders continue to not sell. Back above the 1 trillion $ threshold, #Bitcoin is building up the largest base of capital at these price levels since $6K-$11K.  Each bull-market forms a base of capital 2-3X above previous ATH, marking ""the point of no return.""   Would eye this as the next bear market floor. Exchanges down another 18,084 #BTC ($1.04B) in the last 24 hours.   Some serious announcements are to be made soon. Whoa... Glassnode reporting a massive withdraw from exchanges totaling 11,504 #BTC ($667M) earlier today.  This is the largest transfer seen on-chain in 3 weeks. Who could it possibly be this time? Since Tesla announced their #Bitcoin position in early February, the amount of supply held by entities with between 100 BTC-1K BTC has exploded. OTC outflows are the highest they've been the entire bull run, spiking over the last 2 weeks.  Safe to say institutions are buying the #BTC dip. Largest day of BTC inflows to Binance ever. Remember this week for when BTC is at 6 figures and everyone is calling you lucky Short $TSLA, Long $BTC Bitcoin was here long before them and will be here with or without them.   At the end of the day Tesla needs Bitcoin, Bitcoin doesn’t need Tesla. Bitcoin is cheap and Long-Term BTC Holders know it.   They've added 741,363 BTC to their holdings since the initial price drawdown in late May.  *note: some of this is STHs aging into LTHs HODLers stacking BTC heavily here. Looking at on-chain volume, if BTC breaks above 41K there's nothing but air between there and 47K Long Term Holders keep stacking:  +20,969 BTC to their holdings today +145,021 BTC to their holdings in the last week +397,487 BTC to their holdings in the last month $20M in BTC shorts liquidated in the last hour Anyone that understands network effects knows that #Bitcoin has already won. Another 11,000 BTC moved off exchanges in an hour this morning.  Exchanges now down over 30,000 BTC in the last 3 days. Long Term Holders have added 267,534 BTC to their holdings in the last 2 weeks [THREAD]  Update on #BTC Accumulation Word on the street: there’s a country making a major Bitcoin announcement around 4EST  User growth is doing the exact opposite of what it has following each major Bitcoin bull run peak.  Without any euphoric spike that we've typically seen, net user growth just continues to grind higher. Bitcoin making all-time highs in new users coming on the network. Watching for a big BTC move in the next 48 hours Going back in Bitcoin’s history it’s hard to find a period of time where accumulation has been as strong as it is right now. Exchanges are down -105,011 BTC ($4.3B) in the last 4 days   Are there some announcements coming later this year? Bitcoin has closed 10 straight green daily candles! Bitcoin Daily RSI has officially broken out of a 7 month long resistance $10.2M of BTC short liquidations in 10 minutes and just getting started. #SupplySqueeze OTC Outflow RSI showing the strongest BTC buy signal since July of last year  This indicates buying from institutions/high-net-worth individuals We've got another bullish volatility breakout on the BTC hourly. SpaceX owns Bitcoin  Don't know who needs to hear this but BTC is going to new all-time highs this year and bears will be in disbelief the whole way up. Short-term price action doesn't invalidate broader trends. Price can diverge from underlying investor behavior, just as it has for the last few weeks: but not forever.    Against popular belief, I still see a supply squeeze in play and continuation of the Bitcoin bull market. Whale volume profile, great work from  @whale_map    BTC sitting on a key level of support here. Extremely bullish on global Bitcoin adoption  Blue: Supply held by entities with .01-1 BTC Green: Net user growth on the network  All-time highs in new users, hockey stick up in accumulation from small entities. Bitcoin whales have added +76,441 BTC to their holdings in the last 2 weeks. Miners have been accumulating BTC for over 5 weeks now Bitcoin just closed its first daily candle above the 200-day moving average since May 20th The number of new users coming on the Bitcoin network continues to reach new all time highs. For S2F fans:  Historically speaking, following each touch of this lower S2F deflection trendline Bitcoin has gone on an absolute tear. Friendly reminder that Bitcoin is in one massive ascending channel that will likely break to the upside. This impulse should be enough for Bitcoin to break $50K Structurally, this time actually is different.   Long-term #Bitcoin holders set the floor. You had 3 months to accumulate dirt cheap BTC. Fundamentals only strengthened. The market does not owe you any pullbacks right now. 83% of Bitcoin supply hasn't moved in at least 3 months 70% hasn't moved in at least 6 months  HODLers set the floor. #Bitcoin Supply Squeeze is real Exchanges down 111,033 BTC in the last 30 days. One of the sharpest drops of exchange inventories in Bitcoin's history. Price down today while whale holdings went up by ~13,000 BTC. Funny how that works. Price down over $5K in the last 30 days, meanwhile, whale's holdings have grown by 37,056 BTC (~$1.6B)  Probably nothing idk BTC floor has been set. Large bids across all major exchanges.   BTC came within $1,300 of my on-chain floor model and is still $148,000 from my top model.  Do we trade a few thousand $ lower? I couldn’t care less. The asymmetry of being long over the next few months is huge. Miserable people pray on Bitcoin’s downfall because it rewards optimism Whales buy tend to buy when BTC price is cheap and then distribute to retail as the market gains momentum.  Whales have begun accumulating again since late July, after selling since February. Looks like it’s about that time #BTC FYI: Whales bought another 31,848 BTC today, equivalent to $1.5 billion & Exchange balances now have gone down 10 consecutive days. Introducing: Illiquid Supply Floor   This combines Glassnode's illiquid supply data with Plan B's traditional S2F model, creating a price floor based on Bitcoin's real-time scarcity. Currently $39K  Red: ISF Black: S2F  Special thanks to @MattFaltyn for helping bring this to life Long-term holders have set the floor and continue to lock up Bitcoin at an impressive rate.   We have entered a macro supply squeeze (also shown by other metrics) led by long-term investors. If this trajectory continues, expecting a very exciting next few months for BTC. As a kid starting my investing career, Bitcoin as an asset class truly is the final asymmetrical opportunity. Where else am I going to find that risk-reward profile? An Index fund? Treasuries? Gold?? No. This post from  @cryptowhale  is misleading. (Who is a known scammer)  This is showing the number of whales. He is completely leaving out the amount of Bitcoin supply that whales hold, which has been increasing for almost 2 months now. This was in the on-chain data. Just like the other unidentified whales we've been tracking.  Whales holdings have increased by 103,600 BTC in the last 3 weeks. If Saylor bought 5,050 of those coins, who bought the other 98,547 BTC? I guess we'll find out. Whales have been buying a lot of BTC. That's it, that's the tweet. Just bought my first car. Feeling incredibly blessed and grateful for #Bitcoin and this community.  A year ago today I was working at Target shopping online orders. Exchange balances are at a 3 year low.  Another 21,654 BTC (~$996M) pulled off exchanges in the last week.   Meanwhile, whales holdings have increased by roughly 44,000 BTC ($2B) in the last week.   Ignore the noise. Over-leveraged traders: Rekt Bitcoin whales: Nom nom nom   On-chain tracks broader trends, which are only strengthening. Zoom out. #BullMarket Price down because of a leverage wipeout meanwhile all indications of accumulation grew stronger, including a large uptick in BTC supply held by strong hands.   Bull market is not over, just another shakeout. Underlying market structure continues to strengthen. A lot of people are excited about El Salvador buying BTC in relation to price, which is cool.   I’m excited because we are crossing the chasm in real time. The game theory has begun, there’s no going back now. Can't hold a ball underwater forever. #BTC Exchange balances are now the lowest they've been since late 2018.  -32,148 BTC ($1.6b) in the last week -46,624 BTC ($2.3b) in the last 2 weeks -138,841 BTC ($7b) in the last 5 weeks Taking the semester off, officially full-time Bitcoin! $50K BTC  Some aggressive BTC buying on Coinbase right now Don't let these shakeouts break your longer-term conviction. Over the last 2 weeks, BTC whales have actually been adding to their bags. Minnows also stacking, as always. Yo  @CNBC  after Jim Cramer told your audience to sell the giga bottom over summer and Bitcoin is entering price discovery, maybe it's time to consider bringing on some better Bitcoin analysts.  I know a few people ;) 100% of Bitcoin supply is currently in profit.  Congrats to all HODLers! Just getting started. #bitcoin Bitcoin highest daily close in history! Bitcoin pumping into the daily close Up only $BTC Why would institutions buy into a Bitcoin futures ETF when they have access to CME? IMO just another way for hedge funds to profit by arbing futs basis via cash/carry trade & anyone buying the ETF will be buying at a premium to spot.   Spot Bitcoin ETF > Futures ETF 60K #bitcoin Bitcoin attempting to break out of final major resistance before new all time highs “plz just one more alt season before Bitcoin rips sir” Most people will over trade, get chopped up, and end up underperforming those who just hold over the next few months.  Long and strong. #BTC #Bitcoin up 10% on the day while equities are down.   We like the decoupling. #Bitcoin supply shortage is real After a few weeks of selling, Bitcoin miners have started accumulating again. We were buying BTC heavily over summer at the lows - now we reap the benefits of our conviction over the coming months.    July 23rd from  @BusinessInsider   BTC just hit $49K while stocks are down, interesting Historical performance for BTC during Q4 Maybe these Bitcoin people were on to something about inflation… BTC funding rates have calmed down across the board.   A lot of the greed in the Bitcoin market has been neutralized, for now. It’s time $BTC $BTC  Ahhh I'm inflation hedginggg $BTC  Ahh I'm consolidatinggg This is one of the most ""macro"" bullish charts for BTC that very few are talking about.  Much less of futures open interest is crypto-margined than early 2021. This means the market is less susceptible to major long liquidation cascades & shorts are more likely to be squeezed. #Bitcoin all time high! This week I sat down with both  @100trillionUSD  and  @woonomic  to discuss the Bitcoin market, predictions, and their thoughts about cycles using on-chain data.   This was a masterclass with some of the best analysts in the ecosystem. Enjoy! https://youtube.com/watch?v=8zmzGH7RvvM… BTC volatility squeeze incoming on the 1D.   ""Time to pay attention"" Comparing the cost basis (realized price) of STHs & LTHs has given us insight into the macro BTC market structure.   When STH's cost basis overextends from LTH's, it's time to be cautious. When STH's cost basis is below LTH's, it's time to buy.   Currently far from ""overheated"" New all time high monthly close for Bitcoin ",ENFP,0.0686

 woonomic,"In 2019 Visa processed $138b through their network. Bitcoin processed $727b**.  ** Estimated investor movements, ignores circular payments between wallets and multi-hops. May contain exchange cold wallet movements to new wallets. Data via  @coinmetrics 's estimated on-chain volume. I think Bitcoin just got its first successful beta test of being a war time safe haven, this is a pretty big test for Bitcoin. This last decade brought Bitcoin use from a handful of cypherpunks to 1% of the world. The next decade will bring us to half of the world. Goldman Sachs loves Bitcoin so much that they tell their clients to not buy it, so they can buy more, which includes their investment in Circle. Annualised supply inflation:  USD 21.6% (M2 money, the last 365 days) BTC 1.8%  Gold 1.6%  PS.  BTC 0.8% (in 4 years) And they told me Bitcoin was a risky volatile asset...  (Plotted in log charts so % gains/losses are proportional within each respective sparkline) Seeking the decoupling...  Here's where we are in the timeline compared to the 2008 banking crisis.   Decoupling of safe havens from equities showing hints it may have begun (i.e. when BTC and Gold go bullish). We'll have more confirmation in a week. The next key event is confirmation of BTC decoupling from traditional markets. Here's a bunch of charts, many are bullish. I will note that I don't expect a V-shaped bottom, I think there will be time, an accumulation range before moving up. Dump then moon. We are undergoing flight to safety right now, BTC is looking for its bottom. But know that once the bottom is in there are strong bullish pressures ahead. It's this economic environment in the years ahead that Bitcoin was built for. The Bitcoin 4 year bull/bear cycle is caused by sell pressure reduction every 4 years by the BTC halvening. That impulse creates a resonance, like a slosh of water in a bath tub when you push it timed just right. The magic happens at the impulse. #Bitcoin has had 12yrs of capital inflows with minimal outflows, and a decade long span of doubling users every yr.  Today ~2% of the world population has exposure.  Next year people cease to think of it as a Tulips bubble. It won't ever be this cheap again. The growth in capital flowing into BTC is now equivalent to Apr 2017 of last cycle. The early bull phase is over, the main phase has started; it's come early.  Realised cap estimates the capital invested into #Bitcoin. Its slope = the rate of capital influx (as % of its cap). Gold supply doubles every 40 years.  It's a flawed version of #Bitcoin, but I guess it was the best SoV tech we had in the Agrarian Age. One dollar invested in Bitcoin at its first market price would be worth $29.8m today. That dollar invested in Gold would be worth a snickers bar.  In this chart I've wound back the clock to include Gold's last really big run in the 1970s (when the structure of money was reset). Zoomed view.  $100k is a ridiculously low target at the current trajectory.  $55k is the next landmark -> Bitcoin becomes a $1T macro asset bucket.  We are not at the all-time-high juncture where the BTC Top Cap Model starts curving upwards.  Let's see how high she runs in 2021.  Congrats #Bitcoin! In 4 years, 2024, easily a quarter of the world will have exposure to BTC given its growth trajectory.   I find it ironic that Bitcoin ""maximalists"" find this hard to believe, they've seen <1% penetration for the first 11 years. Exponential growth has  surprising outcomes. The adoption curve of Bitcoin is faster than any other global infrastructure rollout before it.  It's growing faster than the rollout of the Internet, mobile phones, and easily faster than ""virtual banking"" players like PayPal. TV was originally radio shows with pictures, sitcoms came 20yrs later.  Early websites were e-zines, social media came 20yrs later.  Bitcoin currently mimics industrial age finance, we do not know yet how it will eventually express itself but it will define this age. It's important to understand BTC behaves like a startup, powered by an adoption curve.   Traditional investors will compare it gold or label it ""uncorrelated"" or maybe even ""decoupled"". Well yeah, that happens, startups will rip your face off and take over the world. While we wait for BTC post an all-time-high, both on the monthly chart of $14k and the 20k prior top. I'll point out that the organic valuation under NVT Price from underlying long term investors is already at an all-time-high. Price will follow. User base: PayPal 346m+ Bitcoin 187m+  This is a big deal.  Estimating how many HODLers of BTC from on-chain forensics is from the incredible work of  @glassnode . Bitcoin is not an approximation to Gold, in fact Gold is an approximation to Bitcoin.  Gold gets its store of value based on historical scarcity (but only due to technological limitation) while Bitcoin is a mathematical game-theoretic implementation of a perfect scarcity. Square's buy of 4,709 BTC and Microstrategy's 38,250 BTC is the tip of the iceberg. The last 8 months has seen a reduction of 250,000 BTC in the speculative stockpile sitting on exchanges signalling many other *unannounced* investors have been scooping coins off the market. The real news is that Bitcoin is so liquid that it can swallow Square's $50m buy without any sizeable impact on price. The same can be said about MicroStrategy's $425m buy.  Bitcoin's liquidity is already sufficient for the herd that's coming. A good time to retweet this, only 20 days later, Square drops its first $50m into BTC. Nice call by @michael_saylor Gold's having its best year since 2010. This how it's doing against BTC.   $1 invested on 6 Oct 2009 (when BTC was first priced) would be worth $13.9m today.  Bitcoin's software is quietly eating the financial world. Prepare for a great Q4 2020 for BTC folks (blah blah, de-coupling, blah blah, new correlations). The difficulty ribbon is one of my more reliable personal favourites. Final note. Between Twitter and Square,  @jack  oversees a cash reserve of $10b that's inflating away. He has only one word in his Twitter profile, and that's #Bitcoin 11 August 2020, dotted blue line, US corporations led by $MSTR begin buying #bitcoin as a treasury asset. ETH vs BTC, everyone's talking about it. I guess it's that time of the macro cycle again...  This is the battle of the world's two most liquid publicly tradeable digital religions.  (Excludes USDT which is a conspiracy, not a religion)  THREAD We have a 180 degree reversal in correlation to Gold.  Green dot is MicroStrategy's first purchase of Bitcoin. Glassnode doing some important work debunking the FUD that the mainstream press throw at Bitcoin saying ""it's controlled by whales"". In terms of adoption, Bitcoin has roughly the same users as the Internet had in 1997.  But Bitcoin's growing faster. Next 4 years on current path will bring Bitcoin users to 1b people, that's the equivalent of 2005 for the Internet. The last 3 years has seen Stocks, Gold and Real Estate getting more volatile. Volatility is a sign of economic uncertainty.  Meanwhile Bitcoin continues its trend of reducing volatility. Em resposta a  @PeterSchiff It's 2021, BTC $20k->$200k+  We'll need to extend these SI units for BTC HODLing.   <1 Shrimp  1 Crab  10 Octopus  50 Fish  100 Dolphin  500 Shark  1000 Whale  5000 Humpback BlackRock loves BTC, they manage the equivalent of 8% of world GDP. Bitcoin is 0.6% of world GDP in comparison.  This is what happens to #Bitcoin price when the High Net Worth get that kind of validation to buy BTC. Debunking ""BTC is used for drugs""  Bloomberg lead with $1b of activity, while the report concluded it was less than 1% of BTC's activity and declining year on year.  In fact $650b in BTC was sent between people in 2019 this means it was 0.15% of activity. The world has 47m millionaires, 71% of them live in the US or EU, there's only 14.9m BTC in circulation, and only 4.1m BTC are liquid and therefore able to be bought.  HNW individuals just got notified they need an allocation, IMO this is the reason why BTC rocketed past 23k. I want to put to bed this BS article propagated by Bloomberg saying BTC is highly concentrated.  This is the breakdown from  @glassnode  data: - 13% exchanges (130m+ users) - 10% miners (includes Satoshi's coins) - 56% non-whale HODLers - 21% whales and custody providers If you think you're late to the Bitcoin party, think again.   Bitcoin's risk adjusted returns has been at the same high levels for 6 years running. Clearly outperforming every other asset class since its inception. It's whale spawning season.  While the narrative is institutional money, this phase, IMO, it's really institutions have given Bitcoin validation, and now we have family offices serving the wealthy rushing in needing exposure.  There's a lot of requests for $1m+ buys happening. We'll never see $20k BTC again.  $24k support would need a black swan event to breakdown.  Floor price supported by long term buyers is rising very fast. If you want to know why BTC rallied this hard when technical indicators were in overbought territory, just take a look at the underlying buying coming from spot exchanges. The long term buying for investment is also off the charts. #Bitcoin is the first invention of an Internet-native digital scarcity; a problem thought unsolvable until Satoshi Nakamoto solved it.  The Internet can now store value.   Bitcoin will be 13 years old in 2021, this is the year it breaches 2.5% of the world population. The ""BTC is Digital Gold"" explanation carries the most weight for traditional investors; it's easy to understand.  But really it's like saying a cloud-connected supercomputer in your pocket called a smartphone is a digital telephone.  Wait until they see what BTC really is. This is like walking into a forest and noticing the birds just stopped tweeting.  It's unlike BTC to have a run like this without the sound of liquidations... speculators don't usually money in longs with smooth sailing without being a little bit rekted. Replying to  @PrestonPysh 2000 billionaires in the world.  2000 Bitcoin whales in the world.  Gonna be interesting with $1m Bitcoin...   Billionaire flippening. Some bearish scares over whales selling down, here's more complete picture.  Chart: BTC held by dolphin/shark/whales (100-10k BTC)  Whales becoming dophin/sharks, new buyers coming in, cohort is still accumulating, they usually sell in the middle of the bull run. Still bullish. URPD: ""7.3% of bitcoins last moved at prices above $1T""  This is pretty solid price validation; $1T is already strongly supported by investors. I'd say there's a fair chance we'll never see Bitcoin below $1T again. #Bitcoin too free to fail. Investors are redeploying capital from these SoV buckets into #Bitcoin: Stocks 49% Bonds 10% Gold 22% Property 19%  Here's how big these buckets are: Stocks $80T Bonds $100T Gold $10T Real Estate $200T+  #Bitcoin is becoming more than just digital gold Markets selling off due to bogus data saying $1b of BTC flowing into Gemini.   It's the 2nd time it's happened in the last 30 days.  Chart: leverage positions getting liquidated as traders sell off. Red dots showing the timing of the fake inflows. (28k and 18k BTC respectively) Can somebody work out the carbon footprint of the USD petrodollar regime holding back renewable technology for 50 years?  Quit with the “#Bitcoin uses more energy than the use of electric cars” BS. 35% of the available #Bitcoin supply was bought in the last 3 months.  5% of that available supply was bought at prices above $1T market cap. Bitcoin is once again near all time highs. There's solid amount of on-chain support below here.  Chart: showing just how many coins were bought by at each price by current investors. A nice confirmation of the validity of these price levels. 2% of the world population own #Bitcoin. IMO 5%+ by the end of this year. ""Bitcoin is too volatile to be money""  In reality, BTC's peak volatility is on track to drop below fiat volatility (EURUSD) in 13 years, roughly when its adoption base equals that of the Internet. 1) old investors sell early into BTC bull markets  2) each successive bull market HODLing gets stronger  3) check the target HODL levels, very much like the price chart on log scale (climb tapers off), we’ll prob top out in the low to mid 50s; lots more bull market to come. Price and hash rate has always been correlated.  This is BTC price vs today's hash rate collapse (from the Xinjiang blackout). 1,000 BTC will make the seller a billionaire in the next 5 years. By then half of the billionaires in the world will be crypto billionaires.  Billionaire flippening, it'll be a different kind of new world order. Replying to  @elonmusk 1) Banks WILL become Bitcoin Banks. (Banks always go where the money is for them).  2) ""Not you keys, not your coins"" losing favour to convenience. There's a lot of opportunity for innovation in the self custody wallet space to reverse this trend. “Bitcoin is what the Internet wants” - @jack Chart: User growth on the BTC network.  No-coiners are taking this opportunity to buy the dip.   In case you're wondering, the bull market is very much intact.  Data:  @glassnode The Human Genome Project launched in 1990. By 1998 it was at 2% progress. The project reached completion by 2003.  This is the nature of exponential growth.  #Bitcoin's adoption doubles every year. It's currently at 2% global penetration.  Slowly slowly, then all at once. #Bitcoin is banking for the unbanked.   Banks are banking on Bitcoin before they get spanked. This month's shout out goes to China, for selflessly helping #bitcoin remove the last area of major centralisation in its network at her own loss, and the loss of her children and her children's children.  Banning #Bitcoin makes it stronger.   Banning Bitcoin mining makes the network more resilient.   Future generations will look at this time and it’ll be obvious that a decentralised monetary network at scale is more resilient than a nation state acting against it. 2008: idea, 1 CPU = 1 vote  2021: mining becomes a geopolitical decision concerning monetary policy and the wealth of nations  There’s a trajectory worth observing here. And I notice that #bitcoin is still only at 2% global adoption. Replying to  @DocumentingBTC The start of 2021 was defined by #Bitcoin onboarding corporate treasuries, traditional funds, and the high net worth.   The 2nd half of 2021 is being defined by onboarding nations and millions of small holders.   The latter is what #Bitcoin was built for. The genius of #Bitcoin is that it leverages our greed to grow. As it grows, everything it touches decentralises, to dissipate concentrations in power. The brain drain effect is real.   Make stupid policies, your most talented and capitalised citizens leave.  This is why #bitcoin will win, you stamp it out in one place, another place will gladly make policies to net the capital and talent… Zug, Malta, Singapore, El Salvador… Oh my, Rick Astley is back. Coins are moving back to the HODLer who never deserts his BTC. Replying to  @PeterSchiff The estimated user count seen on Bitcoin’s blockchain is growing faster now than any other time in its 12 year history.   Even during this dip? Yes, especially during this dip. El Salvador numbers:  Gold reserves: $86m (1.37 tonnes) BTC reserves: $135m going to citizens Remittance market ready to be disrupted: $685m 2009-2020: #Bitcoin was the enemy of commercial and retail banking.   2021 onwards: Retail and Commercial Banks flip sides to provide BTC services. Central Banks become the competition with CBDCs. @glassnode  data: ""Bitcoin user growth at all time highs for 2021""  CryptoTwitter traders: ""It's definitely a bear market"" Whales: ""Nom nom nom... BTC so yummy today."" #Bitcoin, the 10,000 year view:  Reporters say ""climate change"" Technologists say ""disruption"" Students of history say ""dawn of the Digital Age"" #Bitcoin: backed by clean renewable energy  USD Petrodollar: backed by the Eye of Sauron A heat map of total coins absorbed by shrimps stacking their sats each day. No signs or a bear market in sight.  Shrimps = holders of less than 1 BTC across all of their addresses.  Shrimps control the middle and late stages of a bull market.  Raw on-chain data:  @glassnode Chart: Weekly net flows to small holders (of less than 1 BTC).  It's retail that drive Bitcoin bull markets. When they stop buying, that's a bear market warning. They haven't stopped buying.  Last 30 days: Whales sold 4k BTC, plebs bought 31k BTC  Data provider:  @glassnode Bitcoin is digital gold?  Gold FAILED.  The Gold Standard failed. Gold's failure lead to fiat.  Why? It was centralised. When governments ran out of gold, money decoupled from gold and we got fiat.  Bitcoin is decentralised gold, it removes gold's failures. #Bitcoin at its inception 12.5 years ago encodes a message clearly stating its purpose.  “Central Bankers on the brink”  It’s more relevant today than ever. Historic chart of public company treasury holdings of BTC.  Latest additions: @coinbase   @Hut8Mining   @DigitalXLtd    Live chart: https://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-etf-corporate-holdings/…  Contribute: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13HoxPySRf_KEaj7kYHuxcPUwDh-omo43U2db4NOtDUA/edit?usp=sharing… Just put up a live chart of BTC held in ETFs and Corporate Treasuries.  LINK: https://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-etf-corporate-holdings/… One year ago today, Microstrategy announced its first purchase of BTC. Since then it has bought a total of 14 times, an average of once every 3.7 weeks #stackingsats.  0.56% of the total #Bitcoin supply sits inside its treasury. While gold supply doubles every 50 years, the best thing about #Bitcoin is that dementia adds to the deflation rate. The 3 laws of #Bitcoin:  1) “This is good for Bitcoin”  2) “Bitcoin fixes this” 3) “There is no top, Laura” Here's the projected worldwide Bitcoin users expressed in Internet years:  Internet 1997 = Bitcoin 2021 Internet 2005 = Bitcoin 2025 Internet 2010 = Bitcoin 2028  Here's how the Internet changed... In a macro cycle context, long term investors are still climbing towards their peak accumulation, which marks bottoms. Early signs to me that the bull market may continue into 2022 and BTC is in the process of breaking free from the 4 year internal cycle from the halvenings. Fiat: exactly 50 yrs old today #Bitcoin: 12.7 yrs so far  Both are experiments. One is failing, the other is gaining. It's like everything Bitcoin touches it decentralises.  The leaders of our times aren't even considering that their large power-concentrated and unwieldy nation states will be dissolved. This is what laser eyes should really be about. #Bitcoin has entered the Never Gonna Give You Up phase of the Astley Cycle. It's okay #Bitcoin, don't feel lonely, here's some things that China also banned:  Movies about time travel Alice in Wonderland Brad Pitt Gaming Consoles Winnie the Pooh Harrison Ford The letter 'N' Avatar 2D (3D was okay though) Richard Gere Jasmine flowers Having a big family SPX teetering, threatening a large sell-off. BTC carving out a Wycoffian distribution pattern, speculators selling down in risk-off mode, meanwhile investors on-chain have been in strong accumulation.  It's going to be an interesting opening to this morning's equities market. #Bitcoin is freedom. Banning #Bitcoin would require banning the Internet and computers. Good luck with that. We did get a currency backed by the energy of the Industrial Age. The US petrodollar was backed by oil. Oil is centralised so lead to conflict.  #Bitcoin marks the transition to electricity for the Digital Age. Electricity is decentralised and leads to peace. $100k BTC is critical for sats being the unit of account. 0.1 cents per sat is something most people can grasp easily. Banking and credit cards fast becoming another addition to Bitcoin Layer 2. M2 money goes brrrrr.  Here's the charts for #Bitcoin, Stocks and Gold adjusted for money supply expansion. Bitcoin approaching another region of notable price stability. Short term technicals are weak while on-chain, investors are in accumulation.   All the makings of a volatility squeeze. Breaking 50 likely a fast track to 60. Replying to  @APompliano If Grayscale’s BTC ETF was approved and it charged 0.25% fees in line with many Gold ETFs, it would have to hold 28% of the BTC circulating supply in order to make the same fees revenue as GBTC does today. #Bitcoin moves the decimal point to the left. Fiat moves it to the right.   Two polar opposite trajectories for where wealth, freedom and power flows to. Money moving on Bitcoin's blockchain is back near all time highs.  It's presently doing ~$190k per second. Compare this to $130k per second by Visa for US customers and $55k per second for Mastercard.  Lightning Network not included. Next 3 years, shitting on BTC will be political suicide. Even politicians are bullish on BTC. Crashing 4% in minutes is nothing. Bitcoin can do that day in, day out. The key to resilience is doing that yet never collapsing.   Welcome to real life. It is volatile. Fake stability is never free, when it goes wrong it’s 100% collapse. #Bitcoin  vs Proshares Bitcoin ETF trading hours visualised.  It's like going 2 steps backwards so legacy investors can have access the old Industrial Age way; along with Industrial Age rent seekers in between you and the asset. Contour map of every bitcoin at the price they last changed hands between investors. Huge price validation between $50k-$60k.  #Bitcoin as a $1T asset class IMO is now cemented; hard to see it dropping below this zone.  This data is  @glassnode 's URPD visualised. What’s my prediction for the top of this cycle?  Since I think this is the last cycle, the one that takes us to saturation, which if it wins, we can’t put a USD value on it because things get valued in BTC.  Thus the cycle top is easy to pick. It will be 1 BTC = 1 BTC. 1) Valuation of the banking sector: $7.3T  2) Valuation of inflation hedges (store of value assets): approx $500T  DeFi is competing for (1). Bitcoin is competing for (2). The BTC network undergoes a constant daily sell pressure independent of investors selling. 2017 was simple, 2021 is more complex.

 maxkeiser,"Buffett’s rotation out of banks into $GOLD   - marks the end of all-fiat money experiment started in 1971   - marks the start of 3rd leg of Gold’s bull run started in 2000  - marks the top in bond market   - marks the beginning of $USD crash  - marks start of #BTC to $400,000 The $20,000 level for #Bitcoin won’t pose any resistance. We won’t see any resistance till $28,000. A brief pullback then the assault on $100,000 begins with renewed vigor. #Bitcoin’s got a clear path to $28,000  For the 500th time in 10 yrs,  @PeterSchiff  is wrong *AGAIN* on BTC   His clients are suffering horrendous opportunity costs   I told him to buy at $1 $10 $100 $1000   Thousands told him to buy under $10,000   Worst money manager in history #Bitcoin’s built-in game theory strikes again.   Paypal, seeing $SQ making a killing with BTC, is forced to take on BTC or suffer huge competitive consequences.   Global Hash War is coming! . @PeterSchiff ’s fund’s performance over 10 years HAS UNDERPERFORMED US T-BILLS (ie, cash)   In fact, it’s negative.   It takes a special kind of idiot to manage money this poorly.   Over same period, #Bitcoin up 9,000,000%  Tell me again why anyone listens to his market opinions? Never forget  Alt coins only exist to steal your #Bitcoin $51 Billion Global Investment Firm Jefferies Selling Gold for Bitcoin #Bitcoin is an IQ test... that Mark Cuban just failed.   There’s no excuse for this type of ignorance anymore. And we should feel no pity for those that willfully go down with the fiat ship. This short #Bitcoin documentary is amazing I just ignored and have no interest in hearing any clips of Biden’s speech. I expect I won’t listen to any of them because I’m 60 years old and know even before Biden does, what he’s going to say and what will be written about it.   I HODL #BTC and what I say is this; fuck off Ultimately, I don’t really have a dog in this race; I’m #BTC bullet proof, but just to be clear, I see no difference between Epstein, Hillary, Obama, Bill, Weinstein and Biden. And I see nothing stopping these nuts from committing more heinous acts both domestically and abroad. $16,000 is no resistance   None at $17,000 either   Virtually no resistance at all   #Bitcoin has no top because fiat has no bottom There is strong evidence to suggest #Bitcoin futures traders are manipulating BTC down to give institutions a chance to load up on physical BTC cheap before the break to $28,000 Incredibly important to note that Kazakhstan skipped the whole stable coin, central bank coin, petro-coin worthless step - and went right to #Bitcoin   This will set off a firestorm of sovereign hash-war initiatives   The US will be the last to enter $77,000 #BTC short-term still in play   $220,000 in 2021 still in play Incredibly bullish for #Bitcoin  The BTC super cycle is just beginning! #Bitcoin has no top because fiat money has no bottom.   Look at this chart of fiat money in Germany in 1924 losing all of its purchasing power in a matter of weeks   The  rocketing BTC price is telling us - this is a guaranteed certainty for the $USD and all fiat money in 2021 I’m raising my short term #BTC price target from $65K to $77K based on growing supply-shock issues - as coins are removed from exchanges   My 2021 target of $220,000 remains A country’s reluctance to embrace #Bitcoin is directly proportional to the level of corruption in government. Germany takes #BTC node lead He starts crying 30 seconds into this embarrassing emotional breakdown.   Roubini, show us on this doll where Bitcoin touched you...

Just happened in Silver:  As I’ve been reminding #SilverSqueeze The short-sellers have a trillion in ‘naked-shorts’ available to manipulate the price at will.   A global short squeeze (and physical delivery) will be met with a wall of naked-shorts.   All roads lead to #BTC The sole purpose of all alt coins is to steal your #Bitcoin #SilverSqueeze is the penultimate act of #GIABO before the #Bitcoin uprising finale and global fiat crash   Remember, there is no limit to the paper silver and naked short-selling bankers will use against the rebellion   #BTC has no such problems; will emerge the ultimate winner The entire global economy is short #Bitcoin   Because the entire global economy is long fiat money   Buying BTC is the biggest short squeeze in history   $220,000 in 2021 I’m feeling like we’ll see $65,000 for #Bitcoin during @michael_saylor’s Bitcoin event in Miami this February Welcome to #Bitcoin  @elonmusk $65,000 short-term   $220,000 in 2021    All roads of the ‘Market Revolt’ led by Reddit users lead to #Bitcoin CRASH WALL STREET, BUY #BITCOIN #Bitcoin up 200% a year for 10 years because inflation is rising 55% a year for 10 years.

When it pops, $65,000 will fall very quickly. Exactly.  Buying #Bitcoin at $100 was riskier  Buying BTC at $40,000 is one of the least risky moves you can make. My 2021 #Bitcoin target is $220,000   I’m lifting my short term target to $65,000   - Coinbase IPO Q1  - BTC supply gaps widen  - Hashrate heading to 275 EH/s - Political chaos accelerating  - Money printing exploding  - Gold price suppression continues   When  @krakenfx  IPO?  $80,000 #Bitcoin flips Silver $42,000 in play   #Bitcoin $42,000 now in play   The #Bitcoin supply shock has caught buyers by surprise and now we’re seeing panic-buying   I expect we’ll see our first $1,000 uptick (price jumps $1,000 in 1 tick) With every $1,000 point rise in #Bitcoin more ‘public intellectuals’ feel compelled to speak out and their words reveal a cesspool of intellectually dishonest rot at the core of our public discourse, educational system and mass media.   But we must soldier on  No paper money/ fiat currency these past 300 yrs has escaped a 99% loss in purchasing power and UBI and MMT won’t stop paper money from becoming worthless either.   The problem is with the money itself   #Bitcoin fixes this. $60,000 #BTC Make war unaffordable with #Bitcoin Quick reminder:  The gainz come with substantial risk.  ETH is *not* decentralized  Unlike #BTC the ETH network can be disabled any time. The world hasn’t had a true, liquid savings option for their cash in 40 years.   #Bitcoin is reawakening people’s instincts to build and preserve real wealth  Stumbling out of the fiat money nightmare, a new generation is positive about the future and Bitcoin Correct.  The $TSLA #BTC test-sale removes concerns about the practical liquidity requirements for listed companies.  This will INCREASE CEO/CFO confidence in this new asset class  @elonmusk DEBATE SUMMARY   Frank: Gold *hedges* against money printing/debasement   Michael: #Bitcoin is the *solution* to money printing/debasement   @michael_saylor  @Frank_Giustra  @DanielaCambone What’s great about the DOGE run up is that it puts the lie to the XRP, ADA, ETH, BCH, BSV, BNP, DOT fantasies that any of them have any real competitive advantage over #BTC   The only reason any of these alt coins exist is to steal your Bitcoin The energy used to power #Bitcoin is designed to kill central banks.   Where the energy comes from is not important.   Why?   When central banks are gone - the total energy used globally (160,000 TWh) drops by 3/4  If you don’t understand this, you don’t understand Bitcoin $220,000 #BTC in 2021 still in play.  We’ll see more egomaniacal, wheezing cunts like Elon make false claims, but it won’t stop BTC. #Bitcoin fixes this. Imagine if countries had to buy jets and weapons with *real* money instead of printed-by-the-trillion fiat paper that cost them nothing. Millennials have taken the brunt of:   - 9/11 - 2008 GFC  - Covid   They are fighting back hard AF with #Bitcoin   In 5 yrs, the Millennial-diaspora will be the richest, most powerful political force in the world. #Bitcoin fixes this   (A day in the life of a SA armored car team) #Bitcoin new ATH incoming. #Bitcoin’s energy usage is 95% less than the system it replaces. We should remember that Elon is a #Bitcoin noob making all the same noob mistakes. Altcoins only exist to steal your #Bitcoin   They are *all* shitty exit scam, centralized garbage - driven by narcissists and thieves. Hey World Bank, you and the IMF, you can go f*ck yourselves   You financial arsonists and terrorists *caused* the problem - now #Bitcoin is going to fix it . @novogratz  - What about you guys floating $1 billion in “Volcano Bonds” (backed by future #BTC mining output) for El Salvador to pay off the IMF  ( @IMFNews ) loan - so they can tell the IMF to beat it.  @_amanda_fab  @nayibbukele   @jackmallers I wear white to remember the salty tears of millions who failed to buy #Bitcoin at $1 when I told them. Dumping #Bitcoin miners: China hasn’t made such a colossal mistake in 500 yrs since the time they burned their world dominating fleet of ships. What we’re witnessing in DC right now isn’t incompetence. It’s corruption.   #Bitcoin fixes this Nocoiners after #Bitcoin crosses $100,000 Gold is the poor man’s #Bitcoin As predicted; it was much more likely politicians would scramble to get on #Bitcoin ‘s good side then trying to ban it. Doing a rug pull on the Chinese economy will force them to liquidate trillions in $USD - which will unleash a hell storm of inflation - driving #BTC to $1M   It’s a win-win for Bitcoiners. Today is the day millions of people will start using #Bitcoin without knowing they’re using Bitcoin.   It’s the beginning of when nobody questions, or even cares how it works.   It’s just an inextricable part of their lives - and soon they won’t remember a time without it. . @Saylor  was right about inflation. He brilliantly described the problem; tirelessly, emphatically, for all to hear. He led by example by loading up on #Bitcoin for $MSTR and himself. He reached out to anybody and everybody willing to listen. He saved a lot of people.  #respect Just the beginning of a cyclical move in inflation. This is what the price of #Bitcoin has been telling us for years. She’s afraid.   Also - She’s lying.   #Bitcoin is legal tender in El Salvador - and soon more than a dozen countries will follow. We are heading back to #BitcoinBeach El Zonte in a few weeks. The atmosphere there is incredible. The #Bitcoin standard is happening. The world is changing. Max Keiser June, 2011:  “#Bitcoin  will be the biggest story of next 10 years” | “Bitcoin Is The Currency of Resistance”   Max Keiser November, 2021:  El Salvador will be the biggest story of the next 10 years. #Bitcoin is the great, global equalizer.   http://youtu.be/so1x4hunlII “Well, Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser deserves a special mention on this occasion as he was the first to propose this idea back in June 2021. Back then he said that floating Bitcoin ‘Volcano Bonds’ could help the country to retire from the IMF loans.” He did it! ⁦ @nayibbukele ⁩ announces a $1 bn ‘Volcano Bond’ tonight at his #BitcoinWeek event.    “Max Keiser Suggests El Salvador to Float Bitcoin 'Volcano Bonds' Looking forward to personally delivering this El Salvador edition of  @BitcoinMagazine  to  @nayibbukele    #Bitcoin is  &  gm  From El Zonte, Bitcoin Beach, El Salvador  @Bitcoinbeach Heading to El Zonte El Salvador  in the #Bitcoin mini bus Just arrived in El Salvador.   Since making #Bitcoin legal tender — homicide numbers here are crashing. Yesterday the count was 0    Chicago in USA should take note.   Bitcoin monetizes love and peace. Fiat money monetizes hate and war  @nayibbukele  @BitcoinMagazine When #Bitcoin hits $1M and Satoshis are $0.01, we’ll see sufficient price stability for use as a global unit of account making all fiat money/stable coins virtually obsolete.

También se podrá retirar las remesas en EFECTIVO y SIN COMISIONES. Los puntos Chivo ayudarán a que la población pueda utilizar  @chivowallet .  Esto les dará libertad y seguridad financiera, aparte de recibir beneficios, entre ellos el ahorro de 400 millones de dólares al año en comisiones para enviar y recibir remesas.  #Bitcoin #PuntosChivo Le han estado cobrando a nuestro pueblo hasta 25% de comisión en casos como este.  Por eso se oponen a la Ley #Bitcoin  Están protegiendo los $400 millones que le quitan a nuestros hermanos en el exterior cada año.  Allá los engañados que piensan que se preocupan por los pobres. A partir del 7 de septiembre   #Bitcoin  @chivowallet Un salvadoreño en el exterior podrá enviar dinero INSTANTÁNEAMENTE a su familiar en El Salvador.

Si quieren, si no, pues no descargan nada y ya. Esto será lo que pasará el 7 de septiembre:  La gente podrá bajar una aplicación para recibir pagos o regalos en #bitcoin o DÓLARES.  Si quieren la descargarán y si no quieren, no.  Con ella recibirán $30 dólares equivalentes en #bitcoin para consumo.  Si quieren, si no, no.

Estoy seguro que la cifra será mayor  Y en estas históricas cifras falta incluir el impulso que le dará la Ley #Bitcoin a nuestra economía  How do we make a profit if 1 #BTC= 1 #BTC?  We have a trust fund accounted in USD, but the trust is funded by both USD and BTC.  When the BTC part revalues in comparison to the accounting currency (USD), we are able to withdraw some USD and leave the trust with the same total. It was a long wait, but worth it.  We just bought the dip!  420 new #Bitcoin Should we buy the dip?  Or is it too small?

By the way, we’re not selling any #BTC, we’re are using the USD part of the trust, since the #BTC part is now worth more than when the trust was established.

Esto se hace manteniendo la misma cantidad de #BTC, aunque se reduzca la cantidad de USD.  Por lo que podemos invertir 4 millones de dólares en algún proyecto. Pero se ha dado un “problema” contable.  Y es que, con la misma cantidad de USD y #BTC en el fideicomiso, ahora el fideicomiso vale más, ya que el #Bitcoin subió de valor. Por lo que ahora, FIDEBITCOIN tiene un “sobrante” de 4 millones de dólares.  Sigue... FIDEBITCOIN (el fideicomiso para la adopción del #Bitcoin) tiene un monto establecido, por ley, en dólares.  Sin embargo, en su hoja de balance posee dólares (USD) y #bitcoin (BTC).  Chivo, la empresa estatal que opera FIDEBITCOIN, debe liquidar este monto en dólares a  @BANDESAL . Since yesterday, Salvadorans are inserting more cash (to buy #bitcoin) than what they are withdrawing from the  @chivowallet  ATMs.  And if we add remittances (almost $2 million per day), the incoming USD QUADRUPLES the outflow.  This is very surprising so early in the game. Actually, for people that onboarded  @chivowallet  on September 21, the value of their #Bitcoin has gone up 35% in just 15 days.  Millions experiencing DEFLATION in real time. At least 10%.  Depends on when they installed.  For some, it has gone up 20%.  Good lesson in the #Bitcoin starter pack. ¿Ya vieron sus  @chivowallet ?  #Bitcoin ¿Será que Altamirano y Dutriz ponen la subida en el precio del #Bitcoin en sus portadas, así como pusieron la bajada?  ¿Y qué pasó con la afirmación de que “el Gobierno ha perdido $2.7 millones”?  ¿Se dan cuenta de que no son periodistas?  Solo son activistas políticos. Totally unfair!  Considering  @telegram  benefited from  @WhatsApp  being down for 7 hours     #Bitcoin Como dije hace unos meses, la oposición apostó TODO (analistas, portadas, noticias, manifestaciones, críticas de la comunidad internacional, ataques, etc.) a que la Ley #Bitcoin fracasaría.

 TechDev_52,"$BTC Interesting structure repetition on the 4H #Bitcoin mid-cycle symmetrical triangle looks familiar. #Bitcoin's important weekly retest may be complete. #Bitcoin Monthly Candles Update  Expect September to close here or higher.   Nothing new. Follow the cycle. #Bitcoin will *really* shock you with its consistency. Week #49 that #Bitcoin has followed the path.  But sure...keep drawing your zig-zags to 10K. #BTC likely heading up to the 1.618 at 84K in early November before a decent pullback folks call the top.  Will keep a close eye on the indicators, but none should be close to topping by 84K. #Bitcoin's Q4 off to a good start. History told you what would come.   Now it's telling you what likely comes next. #Bitcoin Getting update requests on this.  Yes, now anchored by 5 points, we are still following a slightly flattened 2017 #BTC path with outrageous precision.  Now 142 days since June. Here’s the #BTC roadmap according to the fractal that’s predicted its path for 55 weeks:  Nov: 65-85 Dec: 70-95 Jan: 95-180 Feb (1st week): 180-280  Let’s see if and when we finally deviate.  If we do I bet it’s end of November. Absolutely incredible.  Some of y'all drawing the same #BTC head & shoulders you did/would have at the exact same time in 2017.  Cannot make this stuff up. No #BTC mid-cycle or cycle top has ever been reached without maxing out the 2-week stochastic RSI.  It can stay there for a month or more, so it's not a very precise top indicator...  But you shouldn't even be considering calling a top until it's maxed.  Nowhere close yet. The 3 weeks after #BTC tops will be more euphoric for alts than most of us are anticipating.  Having and executing an exit plan will be crucial, in the face of emotions which will tell you not to. By December, we’ll know which path #Bitcoin is choosing. #BTC corrected 10% and reset its 12H RSI to 40K levels.  Bull market price action at its finest.  Enjoy the weekend folks.  100K followers. Really don't know what to say.  Ever since the first #Bitcoin halving, its cadence between landmarks has been undeniable.  Leaning into that has been advantageous, and so I'll continue to incorporate history into my analysis.   Grateful to all for your support. Yes, you should get off the 1H #BTC candles.  Be prepared for 10K swings as we go parabolic.  Focus on things like the 2-week.   Indicators like Relative Volatility Index (RVI).  Every cycle's had 2 peaks in the low to mid 90s.  We'll have our 2nd. Currently at 58. 1/3  $ETH is going to 13K min, and it’s probably hitting 20K. On the same path as #BTC 2017.  If it does 5x from here, what do you think the rest gonna do?  Prepare yourself for many of your targets being low.  The emotions will get out of control.  Safest way to exit #alts?  #Bitcoin right on cue.  4 years later.  Just remarkable. 2021 #Bitcoin is repeating 2013 on the macro and it couldn't be any clearer.  5D timeframe shown. I think #BTC sees 70s next week.   Then sideways for a bit.  Then 90s in November.  Then a drop to 60s where everyone calls top.  Then the parabolic run up to peak where indicators tell us the top (250K is my projection).  Wherever it tops, alts change lives.   If you sell. Diving further into the biweekly RSI channel, we see #Bitcoin had a very significant break.  Both times it bounced off the 1.272, it then broke the RSI channel EQ. This led to a 900% pump in 2013 & 2017.  900% in 2021 gives us 370K.  Unlikely imo, but a massive move is coming. Always remember this market dynamic.  The capital flow from #BTC to #alts this quarter is about to produce some of the most ridiculous runs you’ve ever seen. #BTC / 70s gold fractal check...  Now it's just getting ridiculous. I know no one cares about macro during a pump.  But the last two #BTC bear markets bottomed in the 1.486-1.618 log fib pocket of the previous cycle.  Suggests the next bear bottom is 47-60K.  If that's where we land after an 80-85% fall...  The math gets fun. #Bitcoin will exit the yellow circle before you know it. #BTC 2-week stoch RSI currently at the same level as this exact candle 8 years ago.  #Bitcoin is remarkable. As we enter mania, and then the likely fall, keep in mind the two lines which have marked #BTC tops and bottoms for 10+ years.   Bi-weekly RSI channel. Seems like a pair of cheat codes to me.  Compounding at the bottom is how generational wealth is made. This market has a secret:  #Alts tell you if #BTC has topped.  And #BTC tells you when #alts are about to top. It's more than just resistance.   #Bitcoin is in a bi-weekly RSI channel for over 10 years dating back to the original cycle.  Next touch on upper line is probably 2021 top.  Bottom line marks bear bottoms and probably will again. #Bitcoin bi-weekly RSI has a clear downtrending upper resistance.  Dates all the way back to the first 2011 cycle with 6 touches over 10 years.  Next time we meet this line...good chance that's the 2021 top. Reminder of what #BTC final impulses have done.  Many seem not to know or have forgotten. In 2013, a key biweekly RSI level was set when #Bitcoin broke out to start its 1st leg.  The 2nd leg was confirmed when this RSI level broke again.  A similar RSI level was set with 2021's 1st leg.  This level broke again with the candle just closed.  2nd leg looks confirmed. #Bitcoin Gold Fractal Update  No update. Simulation intact. Reminder of where the #altcoin market looks to be headed.  October should continue filling their tanks at #BTC pumps, with November set to start the parabolic rise.  Alt cap blowoff roughly 3-4 weeks after #BTC's. Right as #BTC reaches its .702 fib retrace. You are here. #Bitcoin Posted this before the breakout.  #Bitcoin has finished the retest and is now on its final impulse, same as twice before.  Last two hit the 2.272 log fib cycle extensions. 2017 a little more. That's 200K minimum.  Indicators will tell us whether we make it 3 for 3.   Stay tuned. You cannot make this up. Hope they didn't get your #BTC.  May                                                         October Q4 is on its way. Keep it simple. #Bitcoin Incredible to think how much time we've spent analyzing short-term #Bitcoin price action since June, when all we needed to do was copy-paste 2017. #Bitcoin Monthly RSI  Each cycle has had 2 peaks. 2021 now moving toward its second.  Interesting to note the 8 year downtrending resistance.  We hit that and it's probably top. Or at least a place to seriously re-evaluate risk. Week 53 that an asset referred to as ""digital gold"" has followed the path of actual gold from 50 years ago. #Bitcoin #BTC 8H still consolidating under the 50 SMA similar to the last time it tried to break a falling wedge after basing at extreme fear. The structural similarities are truly remarkable.  Including the latest ATH rejection and swing high retest folks are so bearish on.  I am not claiming this will happen. It is a #BTC model.  Been followed for 60 weeks and is worth using for backtesting and confluence. Detailed 2021 #BTC <> 1970s Gold comparison.  Disturbing consistency for 60 weeks since Oct 2020.  If it continues, next target is 87K at the 1.618.  Peak target over the 6.846 (>275K).  Beyond my base case − simply presenting the model. #Bitcoin high timeframe structure is bullish.  Cycle awareness is key. Updated and revised #BTC ""Golden Roadmap"".  1970's gold fractal now precisely aligned and anchored to both local high and low.   Only Dec/Jan affected with model extending to 1st half Feb.   Sep: 43-58 Oct: 53-67 Nov: 58-90 Dec: 70-110 Jan: 110-170 Feb (1st hf): 180-280 Very little reason to be bearish on the #BTC daily.  Let's see if we close over that RSI trend line. #BTC nice 4H close. When this $ETH / $BTC trendline breaks it's monstrous for #alts. Three #BTC models I am currently tracking.  Next few weeks will be revealing.  Models useful for confluence, but secondary to spotting top with indicators whenever it comes. Liking the #BTC 8H bull div with price at bottom of tightening BBands.  Bottom very close if not in already. Waiting for the #BTC 2-week close over the log 1.618. Looking good folks.  Let's keep tracking.  #Bitcoin is remarkable. Everything I am seeing suggests a high probability the next 5-15 weeks will be massive (including #BTC and #alt mania).  I know some think longer.  Whoever is right, we’ve got a terrific community to help nail the top whenever it comes.  Have a great weekend. $ICX structure looks like young $ETH.  $TEL looks like an $XRP 2017 twin.  I dive into top targets for each, plus $SOL and $DOT.  And analysis of #BTC's latest correction.  Full issue here  https://getrevue.co/profile/techdev_52/issues/techdev-newsletter-full-issue-3-884822… Here's my take on daily #BTC PA since June.  Some differences, but nothing to suggest substantial deviation yet.  Expecting a fakeout below the 50 SMA and close above tomorrow.  I know others expect 53K, and while I am still leaning against, that would be fine too.  Relax. If you think the #BTC cycle topped because of a 15% drop without a single proven indicator near its critical zone…  You’re going to have a real rough time with 30-40%. Looking for something like this on the #BTC daily.  Turquoise peak did not get as high as expected. Break of yellow RSI line did confirm correction.  PA continues to stay 5-8 days behind 2017 since July.   Recovery by RSI break above yellow line, possibly at 80-90K by EOM. The #Bitcoin Top Gauge is based on a combination of historically accurate price-action indicators.  20 = Cycle Low    100 = Cycle Peak  2011 Top:   101 2013 Top:  100 2017 Top:  100  Latest update issue just released on this and key #BTC price action.   https://getrevue.co/profile/techdev_52/issues/techdev-newsletter-top-gauge-issue-2-877105… #BTC just opened and closed a week above the log 1.618.  That's been significant in the past. You'll see me flip bearish on #BTC as these 2-week indicators approach their critical zones.  If you flip sooner, that is fine, it will just have to be in contrast to all of these.  Everyone with respect and a data-supported thesis deserves respect themselves. If #BTC tops at the 4.236, it would be the 1st to top without hitting:   Log band  2.272 log fib  2W RSI channel top  2W RVI low 90s  2W Vortex critical zone  MVRV critical zone  Reserve Risk critical zone  RHODL critical zone  Manage risk based on probability. According to an indicator that's called every #BTC top (and bottom), we are nowhere close.  Our position above the 2W RSI channel EQ is in perfect confluence with our consolidation at the log 1.618, and suggests a massive move is near.  Full #BTC Top Gauge issue out tomorrow. Closing a 2-week candle over the log 1.618 has sent #BTC up over the 2.272 twice before.  Sitting above now. 8 days to close. Every full cycle #BTC has topped just over the log 2.272.  But how much over?   Turns out the linear 5.618 based on a key intracycle high/low pair has called the last two tops almost to the dollar.  This and more in my latest newsletter issue. https://getrevue.co/profile/techdev_52/issues/techdev-newsletter-full-issue-2-849973… #Bitcoin is on track.  Wrapping up the newsletter for tomorrow. Take a peak at the last ones if you haven't had a chance yet. https://getrevue.co/profile/techdev_52…  GN friends. Still gets me every time. #Bitcoin Really interesting structure on the weekly total #alt cap.  From July-Sep we mirrored 2017 perfectly.  Now we look to have skipped a month ahead to early Dec 2017.  Either #alts go sideways for a bit while #BTC runs, or they're about to hit the gas.  Keeping a close eye on this. Expecting minor #BTC resistance around 74K at the 4.236, then a push past like every cycle before.  More on top expectations, key indicators to watch, and alt targets/strategies in my weekly newsletter.  First full issue free to all: https://getrevue.co/profile/techdev_52/issues/techdev-newsletter-full-issue-1-829835… Strap in. And watch the indicators.   #Bitcoin Almost there folks. #BTC Two simple lines are all you’ve needed to call every market top and bottom in #Bitcoin’s 10+ year history.  I’ll do everything I can to help us nail the next pair close as we can.  And we’ve got a hell of a community to help. The outrageous 2013 vs. 2021 #Bitcoin mirror continues. Introducing the #Bitcoin Top Gauge.  2011 Top: 101 2013 Top: 100 2017 Top: 100  Current Reading: 66  I cover this and more in my first newsletter issue: https://getrevue.co/profile/techdev_52/issues/techdev-newsletter-full-issue-1-829835… You're gonna need to panic a lot less on our way up to the top.  Prepare for 5K-10K #BTC swings like they're nothing. #BTC daily looks poised to begin its move up to 84K. Highest monthly close in history.   Congrats #Bitcoin and congrats y’all.  We are now headed toward our second monthly RSI peak like every cycle before.  Nowhere near a top.  Trust the indicators. ",ENFP,0.0710
 PrestonPysh,"The reason I own #bitcoin is BECAUSE the Federal Reserve “isn’t out of tools by a long shot.” Take a real good look at this one.  The S&P 500 since 2012 measured in #Bitcoin instead of dollars.  The y-axis is in log scale - so if viewed on a regular scale it's much nastier. @jack  @RayDalio  @Breedlove22  @TuurDemeester  @bitstein  @pierre_rochard  @mjdsouza2  @MarkYusko Replying to  @ecb  and  @Isabel_Schnabel 2020 year to date performance:  Bitcoin: +32.8% Gold: +25.3% Nasdaq: 19.5% S&P500: -0.28% This was one of the most interesting podcasts I've ever recorded.  Michael's thoughts on economic calculation are unmatched.  Please share and let us know what you think! #Bitcoin @michael_saylor Just a casual chat between billionaires talking about putting #bitcoin on their balance sheet. When in doubt.  Zoom out.   #Bitcoin People saying Bitcoin is just replacing gold, total miss the big mark.  This is ALL about bonds.    Good luck convince the people owning 100 trillion in bonds - which yield nothing - to keep holding when their  future face value & coupons are locked in fixed fiat “value”. Check out the disparity on these two charts -just in 2020 alone.    A growth in M2 money supply by +22.5% Velocity of money DOWN by -20%  Printing is nesting itself into bonds and stocks. It's causing massive destruction of the middle class. You might want to checkout #Bitcoin... Most people on the financial news are suggesting #Bitcoin is rallying because of emotions and crowd chasing.  But if they understood how the protocol systematically sucks supply out of the market during strategic intervals, they would realize this current move is mathematical. But professor...  When you told me #Bitcoin was a Ponzi scheme you left out the part about the four-year halving cycle and two-week difficulty adjustment...  How does that work?    //Thread Post 1 Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller casually mentions on CNBC that he has warmed up to #Bitcoin and now owns it. Behind the scenes footage of Blackrock “dabbling” in any market...  #Bitcoin More coins getting locked-up in derivative contracts for people trying to capture ""risk-free"" spreads. Here's my question: who's going to step in front of this #Bitcoin freight-train & go net-short without first bidding the underlying to write the 100% escrowed contracts?! A new release you don't want to miss.  I chat with Plan B & Willy Woo.  We talk #Bitcoin on-chain analytics and what they're looking for next.  Let us know what you think.   @100trillionUSD  @woonomic Tesla buying 1.5 Billion worth of #Bitcoin is the shot heard round the world for fiat currencies.    If you don’t own it, you might want to start doing a lot of research. It’s not a matter of if you’ll own #Bitcoin, it’s a matter of when and at what price. Ray Dalio yesterday Elon Musk today Who's up tomorrow? #Bitcoin ""I believe Bitcoin is one hell of an invention."" -  @RayDalio Guess what market doesn't have a circuit breaker and trades 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and doesn't care whether your country wants to pull the plug or not...?  #Bitcoin For 6 years I’ve listened to people scream from the mountain top, “but, but, but, they’ll regulate it.”  And they were all right....”they” are now regulating it in a manner to attract more of it into their local domains.  Welcome to the incentive based game theory of #bitcoin. It's hard to believe Bitcoin is up 10% year to date for 2021 this morning at $32,000.  But that's how this works.  If you can't handle the crazy volatility, then manage that concern with your position size.  I'm treating this morning's move as a big buying opportunity. Looks like fairly normal price action following a #Bitcoin quantitative tightening (halving) event. Not sure why everyone thinks this is so surprising.  This is what an algorithmically programmed, unmanipulated, decentralized monetary policy does. Welcome to the 21st century. I’m telling you....don’t let anyone trick you into selling your Bitcoin....  Wall Street wants your bitcoin more than you could ever imagine - don’t give it to them. They are going to pull all the manipulated tricks and lies they’re experts at - Do. Not. Sell. It. To. Them! What putting #Bitcoin on your balance sheet might make your stock price look like...(Ticker: MSTR) Good luck finding someone with a meaningful amount of #Bitcoin that’s actually willing to sell ANY of their position...for anything.....Yeah. Right! Hyperinflation is happening and will continue to happen in 2021 - globally.  If you want to see it, just pull-up a #Bitcoin chart. Finally, an article that clearly explains why so many on Wall Street don't understand #Bitcoin.  Bravo  @Croesus_BTC ! It’s interesting to see the no-coiner pivot from:  I’ve spent my life in finance and #Bitcoin will never work - what fools...  To  #Bitcoin is immoral and something that will destroy society and the environment... Step #1 to understanding #Bitcoin.   Stop looking at a linear price chart.    Linear price charts will fool people (w/out a background), into thinking the price move is emotional. It's not, it's a mathematical supply suffocation provided by the protocol.    Here's the difference. Let me get this straight. Peter Thiel's company was seed funded by the CIA, a majority of it's revenues come from further gov spending, it's unprofitable, and we're wondering why he's concerned about #Bitcoin? Bitcoin isn't the threat, it's the 40 years of manipulating the fiat. 56 million users.  Over a billion in revenue in just 1 quarter.   AND, this is just one of many exchanges...globally.  And you still got people running around saying #Bitcoin is going to be banned. Looks like this interim sell-off might be reaching its conclusion.  #Bitcoin The irony of all these new-found environmentalists on Wall Street is they fail to understand #Bitcoin provides a natural free & open incentive structure for the further development of renewable and stranded energy sources.  It’s hard for professional manipulators to understand. Surprise, surprise.  India discovered that they just banned THEMSELVES from Bitcoin. You mean not having circuit breakers & allowing people with 50X long leverage to blow-up is a good thing?    Like market participants should actually be responsible for their actions if they make bad decisions...  Yes! Welcome to #Bitcoin where we actually applaud these things. I think this is one of the most interesting finance charts in the world right now. #Bitcoin “I’d rather have #bitcoin than a bond.”  - Ray Dalio  Sound familiar?  CPI is broke. QE = Asset Price Inflation Additional UBI checks = even more QE Replying to  @elonmusk This current price action is based on a fundamental change. The unexpected cost to move all this hardware is profound. These mining companies denominated their retained earnings in BTC (sell pressure). Hardware is finding a new home that welcomes freedom and open competition. China, stealing the brand of ""Crypto Currency"" in an attempt to garner trust, but for all the wrong reasons.  The digital yuan will be centralized, debased, tracked, highly censored, used for social scoring, etc.  No one is fooled.  #Bitcoin is freedom, make no mistake. Replying to  @DiMartinoBooth We are watching in real-time, one of the largest network hardware migrations the world has ever seen. All without leadership/coordination and zero down-time. The cost is being reflected in the short-term BTC price action, but the protocol keeps moving forward to free'er domains. It's no surprise we have the largest country and nearly the smallest country on the planet taking polar opposite positions on #Bitcoin. Who wins? The one supporting a free and open monetary network or the master manipulator that's implementing social scoring? My bet's on Bitcoin. The reason Paul Tudor Jones doesn't know what to do with the other 80% of his portfolio is because #Bitcoin has the potential to make the cost of capital a free and open market again.  And if that happens, equity prices around the globe look WAY different than they do now. Similar to how global central banks have incentivized citizens of the world to get in debt up to their eyeballs, the IMF does the same but for nation states. #Bitcoin flips this incentive on its head. Watch El Savador's actions here...it's going to be extremely demonstrative. The IMF is scared.  And they should be.  #Bitcoin makes them and their SDRs obsolete. Now Paraguay?  The sovereign level game theory starting to take shape just like many have been talking about for years. #Bitcoin Be sure to check out my conversation w/ Plan B ( @100trillionUSD ) & Dr. Adam Back ( @adam3us ).  We cover the recent BTC sell-off, China mining, PoW Versus PoS, Derivatives and more.  Let us know what you think. Here's my newly released interview with  @jackmallers .  He knocked the cover off the ball in this interview.  We talk about his new big announcement with near-zero on-chain BTC purchasing fees. Give it a listen and let us know what you think.  #Bitcoin Bitcoin has a fixed terminal supply of coins at 2.1 quadrillion sats.    Yet, somehow, Bitcoin is going to hyperinflate against the dollar...and, IT, is the systematic risk to the global economy.  Give me a break.  People are waking up to the truth of what's happening here. Prepare yourself for this false media headline moving forward: Bitcoin will destroy the global economy.  Make no mistake - central banks are causing this mess. Period  They’re causing the global social unrest, the division, the wealth polarization, etc Bitcoin does not physically harm anyone to FORCE its compliance upon you. The people that choose to ignore it *MAY* find their future buying power diminished. Failure to act on this *POTENTIAL* is of choice &/or lack of knowledge. Failure to question fiat debasement today is  China can you ban #Bitcoin again on Monday? Someone created a fun headline today:  How can a small country like El Salvador protect their consumer when the value of Bitcoin swings 18% on the day it's launched as legal tender.  Don't worry fiat slaves, we use Bitcoin as savings technology. It's up +352% in the past year. They’re all coming.  Every last one of’em.  Good luck steering pop-culture away from this unprecedented incentive structure. #bitcoin Hey Wall Street.    Not only did we NOT sell when the price went down by 55% in 1 month, we stopped going out to eat just so we could buy that much MORE #Bitcoin.  We aren't leaving.  We aren't your slaves. #Bitcoin Lightning Network Capacity up 21% in the past 7 days New #Bitcoin ATH in Japan. What #Bitcoin looks like in Turkey. The irony of #Bitcoin is it was birthed from exponential growth in technology due to decades of globally coordinated, manipulated price signals & cost of capital...and through that, it's going to deliver a head-shot fatality to the corrupt system that incentivized it's existence. #Bitcoin in log-terms.  Total snooze fest.    It's just doin' its thing.  The network keeps expanding faster than even the internet in the 90's, but hey, I'm sure it's nothin'. Right now, the growth rate on the #Bitcoin lightning network is 4%......per WEEK!    Watch. Out. By the way, this #Bitcoin ETF will suck. The tracking error will suck, the fees will suck, the counterparty risk will suck...   Unless you have serious account restrictions on how you can get access to owning Bitcoin, buy the real stuff.  And learn how to take self-custody of it. This might be the best #Bitcoin chart to date.  Really awesome! Get ready Hodlers. All the mouth-breathers that front-ran the news this morning and “cleverly” traded their #Bitcoin for fiat are about to have their bell rung. Many are losing sight of the massive supply shock that’s inbound. H/T  @DylanLeClair_ The  @SECGov  is making decisions on the #Bitcoin spot ETF which benefits hedge funds & Wall Street at the expense of retail investors.   @GaryGensler  &  @HesterPeirce  isn't this the opposite of what you're charted to do?    We want answers! Your decisions are increasing distrust. Here's the beauty folks. #Bitcoin gives 2 sh*ts about the approval of a spot ETF.  It costs nearly nothing to custody and it settles in 10 min.  They are fighting a clock - tick, tock, tick...  This thing literally feasts on corruption and manipulation and boy is the plate full. 6.2% inflation.  And that’s the number they are telling you!  1.48% for the 10 YR treasury  That’s a -4.72% real yield.  Wake-up!!!!     #Bitcoin The magnitude of China's mistake is going to go down in the history books as one of the biggest blunders they have ever made in history.   #Bitcoin mining migration. If you’re new to #Bitcoin and don’t understand it…   And you wonder why the price keeps going up…   Here’s a 1-pager I wrote that tries to answer that.    https://dropbox.com/s/azli0pdo88y4jhl/Bitcoin%201%20Pager%20V2.docx?dl=0… You gotta love watching two American mayors from NYC and Miami flexing at each other on how much of their personal paycheck is getting converting into #Bitcoin.

In 2017, Anthony Pompliano was urging his followers to hold and not sell their cryptocurrencies.  During that same month, his hedge fund, Morgan Creek Digital, sold 90% off their #Bitcoin holdings. Since $XRP was launched in 2012, its  significantly outperformed #Bitcoin in every single bull market.    In the last 2 weeks alone, $XRP has outperformed Bitcoin for the entire year of 2021.

It wasn't until the #Bitcoin bubble popped in 2017 that $XRP saw its massive bull run.  Could history repeat itself?  Tether is the biggest financial fraud in history, and 99% of the crypto community is unaware of its role.   In short: Tether is printing unlimited unbacked coins, sending it to corrupt exchanges, then injecting it into BTC and Alt coins to pump the prices. 80% of the #Bitcoin network is controlled in China.

There’s a high possibility we see a major bounce in alt coins after Bitcoin is done shitting itself. #AltSeason2021  Bitcoin is one of the worst performing cryptos of 2021, and many of its holders are in pain holding it.

Don’t fall for the trap.  Remember just a few weeks ago when they lied and claimed Apple bought in? Bitcoin will eventually tank again, and fall to yearly lows. This bounce is a fake-out rally and is aimed at luring people in for the next big rug pull.  I warned about this pump last week, and it's aging perfectly. We aren't going to all-time highs.

Almost every moon boy and crypto “guru” is saying #Bitcoin is destined to hit $100K+ this year.   I disagree! If $BTC does hit $100K this year, I’ll personally give $100 to anyone who retweets this post. Many Bitcoiners claim $BTC will hit $1M.  To keep its network online, #Bitcoin would need to consume around 12-18% of the world's global electricity.  Bitcoin cannot scale at all and has no real utility, which is why anyone with a brain knows the future is with alts. 68% of El Salvador is strongly against Bitcoin. They know it’s all a giant power-grab by their dictator.  The Crypto Cartel Press (CCP) is refusing to write about these massive anti-Bitcoin protests.    This is what the street in El Salvador look like today… Nearly 45,000 #Bitcoin was mysteriously transferred off #FTX, and sent to an illegal Russian marketplace and BTC tumbler.  This has sparked rumors of a potential hack. Not enough information out right now to confirm that, but I’m keeping a close eye on this! Could be big! Michael Saylor was urging everyone to buy $BTC today at $51K.   He also moved all of MicroStrategy’s BTC to a shady LLC, which means he can now sell without filing with SEC.  My guess is that Saylor is dumping his $BTC holdings on those he’s actively trying to lure in. El Salvador’s government has halted all Chivo #Bitcoin wallets after dozens of “technical difficulties”  The government has full control, they can turn on or off anyone’s wallet whenever they want.  This is Satoshi’s nightmare, and an authoritarians dream come true. The SEC is now refusing to share documents relating to employees' XRP, Bitcoin, Ethereum holdings.   Hmmm.. I wonder why!  MicroStrategy is secretly working on an exit strategy, and will dump their #Bitcoin  Don’t believe me?   They’ve just transferred 92,079 $BTC to a new LLC, which allows them to sell without filing with SEC. John McAfee on $BTC (2020) #Bitcoin just flash crashed to $4000 on Kraken, and to $8000 on Binance. No maxi will talk about this though. BREAKING: #Bitcoin U.S dollar pair mysteriously flash crashes over -88%, below $10,000 in single wick on #Binance exchange, thousands now liquidated. Tether is backed by Chinese debt, which is crumbling day by day.   This is why they’re rushing to pump Bitcoin to new highs. It’s a ticking time bomb, and they don’t have long left before it explodes.   When the dominoes start falling, don’t say we didn’t warn you. The #Bitcoin ETF gives people the ability to pay 20-30% extra in fees to Wall Street bankers for holding fake $BTC clone contracts.    Sounds like a great idea!  Last month, CoinBase tweeted (then deleted) a post claiming SEC approved a #Bitcoin ETF.  Bloomberg also said they were tipped off by an unnamed source about the ETF approval.  Imagine what other info SEC is illegally leaking to insiders?   This needs to be investigated. BREAKING: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially approves #Bitcoin ProShares Futures ETF, which is expected to begin trading next week. DOGE is 1000x better than Bitcoin If you're wondering how #Tether works to artificially manipulate the prices of Bitcoin, here is a simple graphic. #Ethereum CEO Vitalik Buterin criticized the forced adoption of #Bitcoin in El Salvador in a comment he made on Reddit.    “Shame on $BTC maximalists” If #Bitcoin does surpass $100,000 this year, I will eat a grilled bull penis on livestream. #Bitcoin City vs $XRP City.

 scottmelker,"Bitcoin price is rising, but Bitcoin Dominance is dropping...   Alt season. Bitcoin is up 43% in a month.  Let that sink in. Tin hat.  Whales have inflicted incredible pain pushing Bitcoin down with global markets. That said, the best way for them to make a metric ton of cash now would be to push $BTC up hard in the face of a global market crash - this would ignite the store of value narrative. Remember when Bitcoin went to $3,600 4 months ago and people said it was “dead?”  I remember. I have regained access to my account, the struggle is real.  NO MATTER WHAT I TWEET, DO NOT SEND ANY BITCOIN. BREAKING NEWS! BITCOIN DUMPS TO LEVELS NOT SEEN SINCE YESTERDAY! There is no resistance on the #bitcoin chart. #BITCOIN IS IN PRICE DISCOVERY.  Holy shit, it's all happening. Billionaires are LITERALLY telling people publicly that they are buying #Bitcoin and there are people who are STILL bearish.   Corporations don’t buy treasury assets to dump $1000 higher.   This thing is likely going way higher. And they will still buy. Gold drops - healthy correction!  Stocks drop - buying opportunity!  Bitcoin drops - it’s a scam, it’s going to 0, I TOLD YOU SO!  Every market corrects. This week:  - JPMorgan states that they prefer Bitcoin to gold. - Stanley Druckenmiller divulges that he owns Bitcoin. - Bill Miller says Bitcoin will go up - it's Econ101.  It's only TUESDAY. I asked @michael_saylor why he was so passionate about Bitcoin and helping people, considering he is wealthy enough to go about his life as he sees fit.  This was his answer.  Podcast live tomorrow. This conversation is absolutely a must listen. https://thewolfofallstreets.io/podcast/ PayPal has a waiting list for access to bitcoin buying. 2-3x greater than their initial expectations.    The mob is coming. People will buy an expired box of stale donuts because they are on sale but refuse to buy #bitcoin when it’s discounted.   Never change, humans. $BTC  Holy shit.   That's a hell of a wick and some SERIOUS buying volume. $BTC doesn't give a shit about our charts. Can we step back and appreciate the fact that $BTC is worth almost 50k?  11 months ago today it dropped below 4k.   What a ride. The people who are still waiting to buy #Bitcoin at $3000 are the same ones who will buy the cycle top at $300,000 before an 80% retracement. All you ever had to do was buy $BTC and hold. Next time you consider buying a $5 cup of coffee at Starbucks, make your coffee at home and buy #bitcoin instead.  Do this daily and hold for a decade and you’ll likely be on your way to retirement. Exchanges are running out of #Bitcoin to sell and some people still think it will retrace 70-80%. It should go without saying that if you are an investor and not a trader, you should be buying the living hell out of every large #Bitcoin and #Ethereum dip without a second thought. Bitcoin and chill. #Bitcoin is nowhere near its cycle top. It is just getting started. 6B in Bitcoin options contracts expire today, a record.  The last three months have seen price suppression into the close, followed by price increases of 80%, 99%, and 44%.  April has historically been the most bullish month for $BTC.  Do with this information what you will. Twitter: ""OMG $BTC is dumping, it's over.""  Me: ""Monthly chart."" Bitcoin is dropping, but so is Bitcoin Dominance... #Bitcoin to 75k tomorrow or I delete this tweet and pretend I never said it. My dream for the $BTC and $ETH communities.  https://twitter.com/GoodNewsCorres1/status/1379853134944686084/video/1… Bitcoin Dominance is below 50% and dropping hard.   Bitcoin Dominance dropping is a result of strong existing altcoin action, not a leading indicator.   Look at ETH.  That said, it does not look like the trend is likely to end soon. This is the 4th time that #Bitcoin has ""died,"" that it has ""topped"" and that the ""bear market has started"" - in 2021.  Act like you've been here before, because you have. Let me state this plainly.  If you truly believe in the long term value of #Bitcoin, then daily news and price action should be completely irrelevant.   You either have strong hands or you don't.  I am investing for my kids. I am still trying to process the fact that people would sell Bitcoin in April of 2021, because they think that taxes could go up for a select few Americans down the road, even though it has not even been discussed in the House or Senate. Imagine believing that people are selling #Bitcoin because of a proposed theoretical tax plan that has to pass the House and Senate and would not even go into effect this year.   And if you are actually selling for that reason, be gone demon. People on the outside don't realize that we live and breathe #bitcoin, day in and day out.  This is not a job, it's a lifestyle.  Stock traders and investors don't have the same passion because it's about money, not about a belief in a fundamental transfer of power and wealth. Amazing how many negative stories about #bitcoin have come out today without a single named source. Miners primarily use renewable energy.   Also, nobody is buying cars with #Bitcoin. I am holding the most $BTC I have ever had by far. Bitcoin dropped because China banned Elon Musk from making transfers of $DOGE of more than 10k to the IRS and because laser eyes are destroying the environment whilst making it easier for criminals to purchase water guns in Liberia from Janet Yellen. Keep in mind that there are a lot of new people who have not “been here before.” Try to remember your first #Bitcoin crash and be sympathetic. #Bitcoin has erased the entire move that resulted from Tesla’s 1.5B purchases, which means we are obligated to stop talking about Elon Musk after this tweet.   I will break this agreement at some point today, let’s be honest. #Bitcoin daily RSI finally closed oversold for the first time since March, 2020. $BTC  If this actually holds, it will be one of the most epic resistance to support flips of all time. No matter what direction #bitcoin price heads, I will inevitably buy more.   It’s a savings account for my family. I would not be surprised to find out they’ve been buying #Bitcoin 10 year #Bitcoin candle looks great. I am officially mining $BTC in Manitoba, Canada, with clean energy to boot. #Bitcoin back to 40K. Powerful thread on the importance of El Salvador’s proposal to make #Bitcoin legal tender. Elon Musk Vs. Bitcoin 2021 in Miami. The idea that #Bitcoin is digital real estate is spreading like wildfire, thanks to @michael_saylor. He first went deeply into this idea on my podcast, before it became popular.   Worth a listen. $BTC just tapped 42k as resistance for the first time since the epic drop in May. Time to pay attention. Buy #Bitcoin Bitcoin just dropped a bit because  Amazon denied the news report about #Bitcoin which everybody knew was likely fake in the first place? Elon just asked Jack to let advertisers pay Twitter in #Bitcoin Elon Musk - ""I might pump, but I don't dump.""  Also made it clear he owns ""far more"" $BTC than $DOGE.  Outside of Tesla and SpaceX stock, it's his largest holding. Elon Musk just said that the only things he owns are Tesla stock and SpaceX stock... and #Bitcoin  (both personally and through TESLA) $ETH and $DOGE.  And people think he is against us. With 50 minutes left, #Bitcoin is about to print the highest volume 4 hour candle in about a month. You can watch ⁦ @elonmusk ⁩ ⁦ @jack ⁩ and ⁦ @CathieDWood ⁩ discuss institutional adoption of #Bitcoin at 11 AM PDT for free at the link below. “They killed crypto in the United States.”  “This is the end of #Bitcoin in America.”  No.   It’s bad news, but it’s a speed bump.   Crypto cannot be stopped.   Don’t be dramatic. Put on your rally hat, futures have expired and #bitcoin is rising. Every citizen in El Salvador will experience the power of owning #bitcoin. Stock market got absolutely hammered today.   But #Bitcoin is up.  Beautifully uncorrelated asset. #Bitcoin is pumping and volume is rising, hallelujah. I’m not much for conspiracy theory, but aggressive selling into El Salvador making #Bitcoin legal tender when the World Bank et al have already expressed discontent about the decision is not purely coincidental. Fidelity predicted that #Bitcoin could reach 100M per coin last week.  Now they have raised that to 1B.  Even I think this is hyperbolic and I am a mega bull. The notion that $SHIB profits will flow into $BTC is a bit of a pipe dream.   Those profits, for the few who take them, will most likely flow into... dollars. These are retail traders, not crypto enthusiasts.  If they are into crypto, those profits would probably go into... $DOGE Getting paid interest for holding Bitcoin, in Bitcoin, while Bitcoin is rising has to be the most god tier financial hack of all time. $BTC  Nothing to see here. #Bitcoin is now bigger than Facebook by market capitalization. Imagine thinking that people are selling their #Bitcoin because there's a new covid variant, especially when everyone knows there will never stop being new covid variants. ",ISTJ,0.0695

 Breedlove22,"Once billionaires realize #Bitcoin is the sole financial instrument immune to the impending “wealth redistribution” initiatives of governments worldwide, the game-theoretic aspects of money will manifest themselves in a way mankind has never seen. 1/33. I just published “The Number Zero and Bitcoin”  Bitcoin represents the discovery of absolute scarcity for money, an unstoppable idea that is changing the world tremendously, just like its digital ancestor: the number zero.  https://medium.com/@breedlove22/the-number-zero-and-bitcoin-4c193336db5b… #Bitcoin is disruptive to:  - Gold - Governments - Global Warfare  In #Bitcoin's wake: gold once again becomes a shiny industrial metal, governments once again become localized private protection services, and global warfare finally becomes a relic of the central banking era. A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow.  A sat today is worth less than a sat tomorrow.  Buy #Bitcoin, because math. A strong case for #Bitcoin being made here by  @joerogan  and  @PostMalone If you thought holding was hard over the past few years, just wait until the #Bitcoin price is ascending relentlessly, instigating you to sell down your stack.  *Develop a strategy now and do not deviate*  Strong-handedness is more critical in bull markets than bear markets. The current annual new supply flow of #Bitcoin is ~328,725.00 units.  By the year 2100, the annual new supply flow of #Bitcoin will contract by 6 orders of magnitude to ~0.31 units.  During this time, Bitcoin's S2F ratio will increase over 1,118,659X  Buy #Bitcoin, because math. Hacking is stealing.  The US dollar is an unaudited SQL database maintained by The Fed that is regularly hacked by inflation. #Bitcoin is the only unhackable database in the world.  The  @Twitter  hackers tried to trick people out of their #Bitcoin precisely because it unhackable. 1/22. In the spirit of independence day weekend, I just published my latest writing: “Masters and Slaves of Money"" where we explore why central banking is an institution of time-theft and #Bitcoin is a weapon for peace. $900B of value stolen from US citizens via USD supply inflation.  This works out to approximately $2,127 stolen per US citizen (after netting out $600 “rebate” check).  Almost 80% of the newly produced $900B is a political plundering of the US commonwealth.   #Bitcoin fixes this. #Bitcoin is the only private property right absolutely independent of any government decree.  Monetary communism is being shattered by unstoppable, honest money.  Pure capitalism was never possible before #Bitcoin: central bank communism now faces the same fate as Soviet Russia. Many believe government is the originator of money.  In truth, money is the originator of government. The regional gang that controls your money is your government.  Money is the ultimate implement of human governance. #Bitcoin is breaking the governmental stranglehold on money. Money needs encryption to protect its supply from excess production.  Gold is encrypted by chemistry and physics, but lacks portability.  Fiat currency is encrypted by coercion and violence, but lacks scarcity.  #Bitcoin is encrypted by mathematics and thermodynamics, perfectly. Most people are drawn into #Bitcoin  to “make money.”  Those people who study #Bitcoin  close enough stay to “remake money.”  #Bitcoin  is an Earth-shattering monetary innovation wrapped up in a misperceived get-rich-quick scheme. Money is simply a tool for moving value across spacetime.  Gold was great for moving value across time, but not space.  Fiat currency is great for moving value across space, but not time.  #Bitcoin is optimized for moving value across both space and time.  H/t:  @saifedean perfectly said. #Bitcoin is a true all-American store of value. ""Saylor Series"" Episode 1 drops Thursday November 12th. In anticipation of this, we are giving away 1 Million sats (~$156) to a random person who:  - Retweets this - Follows me - Subscribes to my YouTube  #Bitcoin is the truth, let's share the good word #Bitcoin is the global, digital, apolitical, incorruptible, and non-state central bank—an impervious guardian of the commonwealth governed by mathematics, thermodynamics, and the Darwinian pursuit of self-preservation. Whatever mankind monetizes he produces more efficiently:  - Gold's monetization led to more gold production - Fiat currency led to more debt production - #Bitcoin will lead to more energy production  More energy means more wealth, productivity, and civilizational advancement. #Bitcoin is a global, silent, and non-violent revolution of individual sovereignty.  A great ledger in the sky that reconciles the list of who owns what in the world every 10 minutes.  By giving us a set of unbreakable economic rules, Satoshi is saving us from ourselves. Wealth stored in #Bitcoin is immune to ""wealth redistributions"" by governments.  Paradoxically, this singular quality is driving the largest redistribution of wealth in history.  Smart people are quickly realizing the best asset to store wealth is the one that is untouchable. I am long facts, math, freedom, honesty, antifragility, and capitalism.  I am short enforced fictions, bureaucrats, slavery, dishonesty, fragility, and socialism.  To me, #Bitcoin is a no-brainer. #Bitcoin is the demonetization of:  - Real Estate - Oil - Government Debt - Fiat Currency - Gold  Unprepared market actors will struggle on the road ahead. #Bitcoin is the revolution.   But no one is storming any castle...  #Bitcoin is about everyone holding the keys to their own castle. Before #Bitcoin, I wanted to make dollars.  After #Bitcoin, I want to make a difference.  If you let it, #Bitcoin will make you more purpose-driven. 108 years of USD production:  25% of all USD in existence was produced in the past 12 months.  75% of all USD in existence was produced in the past 12 years.  —  #Bitcoin is a non-counterparty insurance policy on The Fed—a contract growing more valuable with every dollar printed. #Bitcoin is the only digital asset in history with zero counterparty risk.  Let that sink in for about a decade... #Bitcoin is anti-poverty tech:  - Makes holders wealthier - Eliminates central bank plunder - Reduces nation-state interventionism - Stimulates cheaper energy production  - Enriches your understanding of reality Money has never faced a more fundamental disruption.  Study #Bitcoin, your family and future self will thank you.  This is investment advice. For the first time in 175 years, a sitting  @NewYorkLife  CEO joins an external board.  When a AAA-rated, New York-based CEO joins a #Bitcoin company, bears go into hibernation. @NYDIG_BTC  has cleared the path for ongoing #Bitcoin institutional adoption. Money is tokenized time.  Central banks “print money” to steal time.  #Bitcoin is the only money supply exhibiting perfect fidelity to time: it rewards people who sacrifice and sacrifices those who seek to steal. Every altcoin is controlled by someone.  #Bitcoin is controlled by no one.  A key distinction that makes all the difference. Lessons for  @elonmusk :  -Do you know what wastes energy? War.  -Do you know what funds war? Inflation.  #Bitcoin fixes wastefulness by making war unaffordable. #Bitcoin is the biggest, richest, and most effective volunteer organization in human history. Central banks harvest the explosive economic productivity gains inherent in the Digital Age by inflating currencies, thereby confiscating the wealth generated which would otherwise accrue to market actors in the form of declining prices.  #Bitcoin fixes this.  Cc:  @JeffBooth The hyper-deflationary future is here, it's just not evenly distributed yet.  To join the club where your cost of living keeps on falling, just change your denominator to #Bitcoin   Cc:  @JeffBooth Inflation (specifically an unpredictable increase in the money supply) is theft.  The monetary technology that makes inflation most costly wins, because no one wants to be stolen from.  #Bitcoin is the only money supply exhibiting 0% terminal inflation—it is theft-proof money. The “killer app” of #Bitcoin is peace. “#Bitcoin will never become the dominant global money.” Once billionaires realize #Bitcoin  is the sole financial instrument immune to the impending “wealth redistribution” initiatives of governments worldwide, the game-theoretic aspects of money will manifest themselves in a way mankind has never seen. Thread in response to  @jordanbpeterson 's inquiry about  @profplum99 's recently published disparagement of #Bitcoin and Bitcoiners. Prepare for faces to melt over the next 6 months due to #Bitcoin price action. @RemindMe_OfThis The “how” of #Bitcoin is science: economics, mathematics, cryptography, thermodynamics, game theory, and evolutionary biology.  The “why” of #Bitcoin is freedom. “Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God.”  Central banking is tyranny.  By working for #Bitcoin you are doing God’s work. #Bitcoin: unstoppable money that stops central bank fiat monopolies from controlling the lives of 8 billion people. #Bitcoin is the biggest bank robbery in human history. Mandatory vaccines are a totalitarian transgression against your most personal property: your body.  #Bitcoin is a vote against all violations of personal property. Successfully wrote my shortest piece ever, a sub-5 minute read, hopefully packing a serious punch.  #Bitcoin is the War on War #Bitcoin is purely a pump scheme, it cannot be “dumped” for a better asset, because there is no better asset. For 5,000 years, it was all about gold.  Then #Bitcoin happened.  Now, gold is a shitcoin. The value of #Bitcoin for humanity matters more than its price. #Bitcoin is the most valuable asset in the world because it is immune to opinion. Thank God for #Bitcoin @SenLummis I fully expect this map to be completely blood red within the next 15 years. Opt out of this global plundering with #Bitcoin Law, Language, Money: Humanity’s 3 most important protocols. Finally, the 3rd transcends corruption through #Bitcoin Fiat currency inevitably devolves into the mass-psychosis of totalitarianism. This will not end well. #Bitcoin is our only hope.  https://twitter.com/BTCsessions/status/1460634707813486594/video/1… In a world running on #Bitcoin, war is less profitable than peace. When #Bitcoin flippens government bonds, each Bitcoin will be worth ~$6M.  Plan accordingly.   H/t:  @danheld Everyone holding dollars right now is being robbed in real-time, all the time. Crazy world we live in. #Bitcoin brings sanity. #Bitcoin is on a path to becoming the ultimate “I told you so.” #Bitcoin is so much more than a hedge on inflation; it is the end of inflation.

It already broke the big wedge pattern. #bitcoin $BTC Bitcoin Porn and The Perfect Set Up... $BTC #BITCOIN   Chart 1 - The Perfect Wedge.  If you use classic charting techniques, it gives you a price target of around $40,000...but                               1/2 This is what I saw in  @100trillionUSD  model when he first revealed it. It gives a great valuation for not only bitcoin but gold and silver too (and other similar assets). It's super powerful for relative valuations and outright valuations for all these assets. Amazing work. I know its not a popular view, but I don't see any way that the dollar doesn't explode higher and US rates don't go negative...I think they go hand in hand and it's coming soon..  Yes, and Im still bullish bitcoin and gold. Also not mutually exclusive. I can not express how bullish I am on bitcoin. We are at risk of losing the entire system right now. I know they will find a way to save it but all trust is lost.  Gold guys/girls - you’ll be fine too. It’s just that $BTC has bigger upside, by far but is riskier than gold Also, further to my bitcoin tweet, I presume you've all noticed that China and Iran have burned cash note thus far. Not far away lies a total cash ban ushered in under the virus... this is bullish bitcoin - digital on ramps and off ramps into sovereign world makes it much easier If you think that the end of all of this, somewhere lies a digital, immutable future, then painful though it is...soon will be the time to add massively. Everything is getting liquidated and this is fast becoming a fire sale... #BTC #Bitcoin I wrote a very long GMI Monthly this weekend (143 pages, 15,500 words). The core focus was this month on crypto, which I think its the worlds best trade and of which Im irresponsibly long.  Here are a couple of pages with some top-down thoughts.. #Bitcoin My conviction levels in bitcoin rise every day. Im already irresponsibly long. I am now thinking it may not be even worth owning any other asset as a long-term asset allocation, but that's a story for another day (I'm still thinking through this). In fact, only one asset has offset the growth of the G4 balance sheet. Its not stocks, not bonds, not commodities, not credit, not precious metals, not miners. Only one asset massively outperformed over almost any time horizon.  Yup. #Bitcoin $BTC One day, this bloody range will break...$BTC #Bitcoin. The time for the crypto rally seems fast approaching...  #Bitcoin $BTC is getting ready hopefully to break the small wedge... We are at the stage where people I really respect - mean reversionists, value players and rationalists are urging caution in bitcoin. Right, off to bed but I'll leave you with this - The last 2 days rise in bitcoin would annualize at 1000%. Good night and good luck. Corrections will come at some pint, some will be scary. Buy them. BTW - I think 10x is more than realistic. I'm about to present The World's Best Trade (aka Bitcoin) to 150 European hedge funds and asset managers. Wish me luck. #wallofmoney Bitcoin is eating the world... A few things to make you think...  If bitcoin is the digital pristine collateral, the size of global gov bond market is $123trn.   Pretty amazing opportunity for bitcoin. I asked one simple question about ETH and my feed has blown up into a full on tribal shit fight! BTC vs ETH is simply not the point. They are not the same thing and never will be. It's fine. You also don't have to agree and Im cool with that too. Bitcoin!

The next thing I'm expecting is the correlations between BTC and the dollar and BTC vs equities to break down too... let's see. #Bitcoin Its a bitcoin kind of day. The monthly log chart with regression lines is really something to behold. One of the nicest, post powerful chart patterns I've ever seen... #BITCOIN You asked for more on the New Bretton Woods and bitcoin so here it is, for free, so share it with everyone as it is so damned important!  F&ck the system! The Bitcoin Life Raft: The End of Monetary & Fiscal Policy As We Know It... https://youtu.be/qL2LfVRl3J0 via  @YouTube The Wall of Money is coming.  Bitcoin is protection as a pristine reserve asset. Bitcoin is freedom. Bitcoin is future value and bitcoin is THE future.  Everything is changing and its changing fast.

Welcome to Real Vision Crypto, our new baby - currently only available to RV members. #Bitcoin   The Deliberate Corporate Strategy to Adopt the Bitcoin Standard | Real Vision So, as its Saturday night, I want to ask BTC twitter a question: You are generally libertainarians in philosophy right? And I am the Founder of a media platform, that encourage free speech, but if I book someone who is not a Bitcoiner, you are in outrage. Huh? WTF people. It it just me that feels relief when the BTC sell offs come? You know they are coming but when they finally arrive you can switch into buy the dip mode. March is a historically weak month. Not sure if this is the bigger March correction of just another cheeky shakeout . Yes, there is a bitcoin revolution but there is a digital asset revolution going on that is beyond incredible. It is very early days, like BTC in 2013, but it's happening. Some will be on the BTC blockchain but the vast majority will not be. 1/ Presume you all saw this? Not a big suprise but it is the worlds largest asset manager and they have already bought some BTC. #Bitcoin I, for one, would like to thank  @100trillionUSD  for everything he has done for us all. He, almost above all, gave us the anchor and the framework around to which take risk and understand the power of BTC, for which all of us owe him a HUGE debt of gratitude. Bravo my friend! Im not sure if you have yet seen Bridgewater's Daily Observations on Bitcoin. Just out... entire piece is dedicated to it and is rather positive, for those of you that care about such things. 1/ Feels like BTC is getting ready to climb the wall of FUD fear. Positive seasonality and a nice wedge give it a good chance to hit $50k by March. Let's see... I remain, as ever, #irresponsiblylong. At this point and for a while, ETH leads, Alts season follows and bitcoin still explodes higher. Everyone wins. Enjoy and take on board the FUD with a open mind but remember, in an exponential bull market everyone wants to spook you out of your trade. It’s really not easy. For longer-term HODLers of BTC and ETH this is probably a good time to start accumulating more. Personally, Ive added more ETH and now time to add more speculative crypto. Have not pulled trigger yet as doing some homework on it. Good luck ! Ugly price = opportunity. Danger! : Im going to add a basket of 10 alts to my BTC and ETH bets, using this dip. Shill me your coin but with a quality paragraph WHY I should look at it. My knowledge base is low, so treat me like the idiot I am (nicely)    Maxi aggressive ""shitcoin"" posts = insta bloc  Go. By the way, ETH is up 60% in the first 14 days of the year. I think it outperforms all year but I still own much more BTC but have been adding to ETH. Next stop will be higher risk alts.... but much much smaller. More risk = smaller size. Again, if you didn’t read the charts, ETH is the EXACT same price as BTC in 2017. TheY have/had EXACT same market cap too. They look EXACTLY the same in price structure... BTC from 2016 versus ETH from 2020. It’s bizarre and it’s all Metcalfe’s Law. Enjoy stirring up twitter tonight.. “bitcoin only” people are basically Peter Schiff gold bugs. Hilarious. You become what you hate...much like we all become our parents, no matter how much we rebel. Closed mind or open mind. You choose. Next crazy bitcoin take...  Me: This project is interesting and might have some future value   Weird BTC twitter: BTC is the only money! This is a scam!  Me: value and money are two different things  Weird BTC twitter: scam! Shitcoin! traitor! Stone him! Stone him!”  Me: sigh I'm finding it fascinating to see traditional finance and business people first trying to get their heads around BTC, then other crypto protocols, then Defi and now NFT's.   1/ BTC - Feels like yet another wedge... While I'm at it - Yield Curve Control. I hope you all realise that QE is a fixed $ amount at any price, but YCC is a potentially unlimited amount of $'s at a fixed price. This mechanism moved 65% of the entire JGB market into the BoJ. This would be a seismic shift and = BTC  Kind of feels like a big deal to see BTC break a 3 month range and a wedge. It should create a powerful move to the upside. (Axis scrunched on chart to hint at the upside for dramatic effect.  )#Bitcoin At this point in the risk cycle and with ETH 2.0 coming (cheaper fees and less supply), I'm struggling to not sell all my BTC to move my entire core position to ETH.   To be clear - I'm a massive BTC bull, but I think ETH is the better asset allocation for performance right now. To be brutally honest, I stare at the chart of ETH/BTC and I see an enormous rounded bottom with potentially huge breakout just above.... Small thought for the day -   Since inception in 1896 the Dow Jones has risen by 90,000%. If you add in dividends, you might get to 200,000%.  MSFT 330,000% AAPL 88,00% AZMN 138,000%  Bitcoin since inception in 2010 has risen 105,000,000%  Indeed. Let's quickly update the Bitcoin Super Massive Black Hole. My theory is that no investment will beat crypto this year and it will suck in more and more capital...  Lets look at the scores of the doors... If you want to know how the FBI can find Bitcoin so easily watch this incredible story of The Silk Road bust....  @RealVision Kind of a very big level coming up in ETH/BTC...would confirm potential moves to all time highs in the pair if 0.8 breaks. How to allocate to crypto:  Does the project have provable network effects? Or might it have future network effects? The former suggests higher allocation of risk budget, the latter, less.   BTC and especially ETH have it all. Others - yet uncertain.  ETH is growing exponentially Just an update of the favorite crypto charts...  Here is the log chart parallel of BTC now vs 2013... still fits decently well. 1/ What I really don't get about Tether fears is this:  Let's say its right and Tether implodes to zero. What happens to Bitcoin or digital assets? Down 30% immediately? down 50%? down 60% down 80%?  Ok. Well, we just did that (many tokens were down 80%) and guess what? 1/ Just writing Global Macro Investor and dont want to spoil it in advance but so many people look at on chain analysis for BTC and forget ETH. On chain data + August 4th  + network growth = ludicrous, ludicrous supply shortage (double ludicrous for emphasis in case you missed it) Just because perspective is useful for everyone... this is ETH 2021 vs BTC 2017 Final post - to reiterate my point that crypto IS macro.   Every, single, non-Crypto Asset is down 95% plus vs BTC in the last 10 years.   Every. Single. One. h/t  @DTAPCAP I obviously also own BTC and a whole bunch of other crypto (layers 1's, Defi and interoperability stuff).   I think the most undervalued plays for the future (not now) are  @rally_io  ,  @Chiliz  ,  @dapperlabs  ,  @TheSandboxGame  ,  @decentraland  , and other metaverse and social tokens You know someone should start a DeFi DAO that arbs BTC futures and shares it with token holders as a yield generator. Then everyone can participate. Talking of luscious charts, the ETH/BTC cross has seen a lovely consolidation and should move to near double from here if and when the wedge breaks. #Ethereum I have been showing this spooky chart of ETH now vs BTC in 2017 in various forms. This is my live CIX on Bloomberg.... even nailed this sell off....to the day and price. What happened next? A 300% rally. From tomorrow (ish).  1/ ",ENFP,0.0827
 gladstein,"Yes, wealthy people, corporations, and governments can obtain more Bitcoin than others.  But no matter how rich they are, they can’t change the rules, confiscate your savings, censor your transactions, prevent your access, or print more.  That’s a big deal! Bitcoin’s market cap just hit a half *trillion* dollars.  Governments still can’t censor or shut down the network.  They still can’t print more.  They still can’t change its rules.  You can still use it, no matter your ideas or identity.  But yeah, probably just a tulip. Important to reiterate:   No, Bitcoin isn’t “too expensive,” there are 100 million satoshis per BTC  Each satoshi is cheaper than any altcoin but far more valuable  You are very early, not late  The smartest investment you can make is your time into learning about Bitcoin There are massive protests in Nigeria against police brutality: #SARSMustEnd  Organizers like  @feminist_co  are crowdfunding for gas masks, legal aid, etc. But their bank accounts are being frozen.  Thankfully, you can donate Bitcoin via  @BtcpayServer :  https://donatebtc.feministcoalition2020.com Bitcoin critics:   Blah blah blah, Bitcoin bad, blah blah  MIT:   Establishes multi-year effort to invest in Bitcoin’s long-term security, research and mitigate protocol risk, and attract more developer funding and new world-class contributors Only in the article do they tell you that this headline is based on a quote from the central bank.  In reality, Bitcoin is a way for Nigerians to escape 13% inflation and economic isolation. Why hasn’t Bitcoin been stopped?  My new essay for  @Quillette  dives into the political, economic, social, and technological reasons why this new financial system is undefeated: Wow. Incredible thread. You are watching a government grapple in real time with Bitcoin and try to understand how they can co-exist. My latest for  @TIME :  In the fight against extremism, don't demonize mass surveillance-busting tools like Signal and Bitcoin.  If we sacrifice privacy to protect our democracy, we will end up with neither. Important to keep in mind:  Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work was invented to escape Proof-of-Stake financial systems, where the largest asset owners can unduly influence the rules of the game.  Thanks to PoW + full nodes, neither miners nor the biggest BTC hodlers can change the protocol. A nation of 82 million sees its currency crash 15% in a single day.  No coincidence that Turkey has some of the highest per-capita Bitcoin usage in the world.  A growing number of Turks are peacefully choosing a different monetary system that their oppressors can’t control. 1/ The Aker shareholder letter from Kjell Inge Røkke is remarkable.  Having worked in Norway since 2008, IMO this is a major step towards more Scandinavian Bitcoin discussion + adoption.  Here's a  on the letter's unexpected highlights especially regarding Lightning + privacy: Unlike gold, Bitcoin teleports and evolves.  Unlike real estate, no wear and tear.  Unlike fiat, users control the mint.  Unlike bank deposits, you don’t need ID.  Unlike stocks, trading can’t be stopped.  Unlike bonds, no one can default.  Unlike altcoins, anyone can verify 21M. Superb article about Bitcoin’s unstoppable rise in India by  @baidakova :  -WazirX is the largest exchange in India w/ 1.8M users -Most users “just buy and hold” -CEO estimates 6M Indian hodlers -Despite ban rumors “everyone he knows” is curious about BTC “Ethererum has said it is moving toward proof of stake and Bitcoin is expected to eventually follow.”  It’s frankly absurd that the  @nytimes  could publish this nonsense, which speaks volumes about the awful state of MSM Bitcoin coverage today. Many are perfectly happy to support military activities backed by fossil fuels, without ever questioning the carbon footprint of such violence.  But Bitcoin, which peacefully empowers people, THAT we must question. 1/ It is *really important* to understand that Bitcoin is very different from Dogecoin.  Some are making jokes comparing the two, especially as Doge has outperformed BTC + ETH this year.  Many of you already know, but for everyone else, here are some of the key differences  1/ My latest essay is live:  ""The Humanitarian and Environmental Case for Bitcoin""  Could Bitcoin reduce ""middleman"" corruption in aid, bootstrap electrification via untapped renewables, and help developing nations end dependency on foreign powers? Amazing to watch this central banker let his guard down for a few seconds and basically say if you want to challenge the financial system with Bitcoin you’ll want to run a full node. Otherwise it’s not going to work.  Listen to this man, folks! 1/ **A World Without Bitcoin**  What would the future look like if Satoshi had never invented decentralized digital scarcity?  If we didn't have open-source, non-discriminatory money beyond the control of corps and govts?  Here's a sci-fi look into that parallel universe : The government of El Salvador is planning to airdrop ~3,000 BTC into the hands of its citizens.  And they can’t even print money to buy the Bitcoin.  This will be really crazy to think about 10 years from now. Showed someone halfway around the world how to set up a Bitcoin wallet today. Sent them some BTC on-chain and via LN, and had them send LN back to me.  ""But I never had to put my ID in?""  No :)  ""Wow. It appeared instantly!""  Yes :)  Information is powerful tool, let's use it  Struggling govt adopts petrodollar as legal tender, becomes de facto US client state  Economists: Sounds good to us  Struggling govt adopts BTC as legal tender, pushes country towards open-source money that no central bank can censor or debase  Economists: This is a disaster Estamos muy felices de anunciar que ahora estamos ofreciendo El Pequeño Libro de Bitcoin ( @LittleBitcoinBk ) como in PDF en español gratuito para ayudar a personas en El Salvador y en toda Latino América a aprender sobre libertad monetaria!  https://littlebitcoinbook.com Why does Bitcoin matter for human rights?  Why are so many people excited about El Salvador adopting this new currency?  A few months ago I produced a video for  @reason  that explains why.  Grateful for the 1.2M views, hope you all find it helpful too  So many are just completely missing the historical importance of what is happening in El Salvador.  The govt could have pushed a surveillance and control coin, a civil liberties-stripping CBDC, a China project...  No! They went with Bitcoin. Freedom money.   Just remarkable. Bitcoin Signal:    Nation-state adoption  Continuous global user growth  Taproot activation  Improving mobile UX  Entry by smart macro investors  Bitcoin Noise:    Whatever you read in the newspapers, see on TV, or hear on the radio Me: Wow, a country seems to be adopting Bitcoin at the national level.  Media and experts: It’s not a big deal. And probably won’t work. Trust us. And please look right here: A lot of people seem confused about why it’s good that a questionable leader is promoting the use of Bitcoin in his country, so it’s a very good time to revisit Bitcoin Trojan Horse theory:  https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-a-trojan-horse-for-freedom… Historic moment.  El Salvador on track to become the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender and to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset.  The future is wide open. @JackMallers  is a legend. 1/ My essay ""Bitcoin and the American Idea"" is now live.   was born 245 years ago but strayed from its founding ideals.  Can Bitcoin help it get back on track?  An African American activist ( @bitcoinzay ) and an Iraqi refugee ( @faisalalmutar ) say yes  Same billionaire that calls Bitcoin “contrary to the interests of civilization” calls for the US to be more totalitarian, communist, and censorious.  What kind of civilization, exactly, does he have in mind? Grateful for those trying to convince the govt to not pass restrictive legislation but ultimately Bitcoin is the product of activists who thought we should seize — not beg for — our freedoms.  This quote from Wei Dai (a Cypherpunk cited in the Bitcoin White Paper) sums it all up: “Bitcoin is digital real estate” @udiWertheimer  made a good meme  But BTC is actually something much more profound: the instantiation and realization of real property rights.  It’s the first time in history when people can essentially make their time and energy *unconfiscatable* Despite the claims below, the Uniswap ecosystem is absolutely being forced to change under regulatory pressure.  This is why decentralization matters. This is why Proof-of-Work matters. This is why user control through full nodes matters.  This is why we Bitcoin. To those who dismiss, deride, or condemn Bitcoin and say it’s not a tool for human rights:  Bitcoin will do more in the next 24 hours for human rights and freedom worldwide than you will ever achieve in a lifetime. “Why Progressives Should Love Bitcoin: An Open Letter to Senator Elizabeth Warren”  This is superb, from recent political science graduate Samantha Messing: 1/ My essay ""Inside Cuba's Bitcoin Revolution"" is now live.  Mired in their worst economic crisis since the early 90s, Cubans face tyranny, shortages, blackouts, the embargo, and a collapsing peso.  A growing number are finding hope through Bitcoin  What’s most remarkable is that Bitcoin has developed an immune system capable of fighting government regulation at the highest levels inside the most powerful nation on earth. All without any centralized leadership. A peaceful but powerful incentive structure drives it forward. Wow.  @rjames_BTC  has created a masterful 30 minute documentary on the history, impact, and future of the petrodollar system based on my essay and conversations with  @nic__carter . Lots of  @TheGuySwann  in this one, too!  Full video: https://petrodollarsfilm.com A couple headlines from today:  -Substack adds Bitcoin payments -2nd largest US home lender accepts Bitcoin -El Salvador installing Bitcoin machines nationwide -Iran reverses Bitcoin mining ban -US central banker attacks Bitcoin  The milestones are becoming a blur. Why Bitcoin matters for human rights, in 2 minutes.  I released this video in June 2020 but the case remains stronger than ever.  In a digital world we need a people’s money outside the control of governments and corporations.  Thankfully, we have one  We live at a time when citizens can opt into a digital currency that no government can control or debase.  This is revolutionary as we continue to watch regimes fall and fiat collapse, with the people always left paying the biggest price.  Bitcoin is a shield against this theft. Tesla buys Bitcoin.  El Salvador adopts Bitcoin.  Twitter adds Bitcoin.  Central banks attack Bitcoin.  200M users, growing faster than the internet.  And yet, most people in finance and economics are totally oblivious to what is happening.  What a world!  1/ Why is Bitcoin a Trojan Horse for freedom?  Because it stealthily co-opts actors who do not care about or do not even like freedom and forces them to promote it anyway   https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-a-trojan-horse-for-freedom… 1/ My latest essay ""The Village and the Strongman: the Unlikely Story of Bitcoin and El Salvador"" is now live.  How did the smallest country in Central America—most known for its civil war and gang violence—become ground zero for a monetary revolution?  “The plan is for Ukraine to make Bitcoin legal tender by the start of 2023 and create a ‘duel-currency country’ where Bitcoin sits alongside the fiat hryvnia before potentially being phased in as the dominant financial structure” The Ukrainian parliament has passed a law to legalize Bitcoin  The year is 2021.  A nation state has just announced on a popular global social media platform called Twitter that it has bought $10 million in Bitcoin. 1/ As Tuesday's Bitcoin legal tender law looms for more than 6 million Salvadorans, many if not most of them fear a big monetary change.  This is partly because of the dollarization which occurred exactly 20 years ago, in a similarly rushed, top-down way   Critics: ""Bitcoin has no use case""  Ok, here's me in a small village in Central America quickly transforming Bitcoin from my open-source, non-custodial, non-KYC mobile wallet into a $10 bill for a small fee. Flawless experience using  @MuunWallet  here in El Zonte to buy all sorts of things with Bitcoin   If you visit, make sure to stop by for a coffee with Karla, an excellent barista.  You can tip her instantly from anywhere in the world with Lightning here:  https://strike.me/karla Bitcoin is scarce, crypto is infinite People skeptical that Bitcoin can still work if all hell breaks loose are apparently completely unaware that it is keeping millions of people afloat right now where all hell *already* broke loose in Iran, Venezuela, Gaza, Sudan, and many other places Banks, corporations, and Western governments continue to loot and impoverish citizens of the developing world.  Bitcoin will empower them   At approximately $72,800, Bitcoin will surpass the total value of all the silver in the world.  That's the next big milestone for Satoshi Nakamoto's remarkable invention, once just a string of code on a solitary computer, running quietly in the wake of the Great Financial Crisis. Ok Bitcoin critic, what’s your alternative?  Minimum requirements:   Works anywhere  Teleports instantly  Neutral/open-source  No corporate control  Increases user purchasing power  Easy/cheap to audit/self-custody/transact/verify  Runs on      We’ll wait  Bitcoin just activated a major upgrade, increasing privacy, flexibility, and efficiency for global digital sound money… with no major opposition and—you have to think—basically all government officials and bank executives not even having a clue that it happened  Bullish  Say what you want about the Elon thing but if he bought $6 billion of Bitcoin today and then in 10 years distributed it evenly among the world's poorest billion — ~10,000 sats per person — it would be the most powerful and disruptive act of philanthropy of all time.

Independent auditability has value. You know what the real news is from this incident?  Someone appears to have root level access to Twitter. They OWN this platform. They are in GOD MODE.

Because they haven't put in the work. China has banned Bitcoin countless times and yet they have yet to block port 8333 at the Great Firewall Miners don't waste energy securing Bitcoin. The military industrial complex wastes energy securing the petrodollar. Wait 'til  @elonmusk  finds out that the most prolific dogecoin developers are Bitcoin Core contributors. Bitcoin has... no charismatic leader no funded foundation no governance token no vesting schedule no steering council no partnerships no fancy offices no VC backing no legal team no pre-mine no roadmap no rulers In 2 days the Bitcoin network will automatically retarget a new mining difficulty just like it has hundreds of times since 2009.  This will be the largest downward adjustment in its history, in both absolute (-5272851131000) and relative (-26%) terms.  Bitcoin's  keeps beating. Normally in order for an internet service to relocate major infrastructure without downtime requires massive amounts of planning and coordination.  And yet we're watching a tectonic shift in Bitcoin mining infrastructure occur without anyone in charge.  Bitcoin's Taproot upgrade will lock in tomorrow and will activate at block 709,632 in November  You shouldn't like Bitcoin simply because Elizabeth Warren hates it. You should like Bitcoin because people who want to control you hate it. Independence Day seems an appropriate time for us to reflect upon the cost of freedom.  In my first contribution to Forbes I make the case that Bitcoin substantially lowers the cost of financial freedom. After 9 years of studying it I'm certain that Bitcoin is an inherently anarchic, hyper-capitalistic technology built primarily to disempower its detractors through a combination of cryptography, incentives, individual sovereignty, and community-enforced scarcity. I'm launching a new project today at https://bitcoinpoliticians.org  The goal is to crowdsource the effort required to go through Congressional financial disclosures to create more transparency around bitcoin ownership. I've analyzed 13% of the 538 reports - let's crush the rest! ",INTJ,0.0583

 BitcoinIsSaving,"If it’s not Bitcoin, it’s not your money. This marks the beginning of the end for fiat, and the end of the beginning for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is going mainstream because it is reinventing savings: can now hold your own digital cash without credit or dilution risk. If you own 10 bitcoin you are literally a billionaire.  Few understand this. Austrian economists were right, holding cash is rational and makes for a resilient economy.   Keynesian economists were wrong, using inflation to penalize holding cash just benefits politicians and makes for a fragile economy.  #Bitcoin lets people opt out of Keynesian madness. Bitcoin is the only free market in the world. Bitcoin doesn’t have a “limit down” or “circuit breakers” because it is a real market with a real clearing price.  Stocks and bonds are not real markets, they are Potemkin villages, their prices are highly manipulated and political. Bitcoin has proven itself to be easier to liquidate than:  • stocks • bonds • real estate • gold  All thanks to 24/7 final settlement and 24/7 exchange trading.  The smart money is learning this. Bitcoin proved that it is the ultimate safe-haven asset yesterday. Even in a crisis, the network stays up, the exchanges trade 24/7, and the market found a healthy clearing price - well above the 2015 low. Very impressive! Bitcoin is easier to understand than fiat. Buy 0.01 btc at least.  That is 1,000,000 satoshis (sats).  Hold it, you might need it later to buy food for your family. Bitcoin will stop wars. There’s a bitcoin shortage. Governments should send everyone 1 bitcoin to stimulate the economy. Bitcoin is saving, not investing. Young people: focus on working to accumulate bitcoin.   High school and college can wait. 10 bitcoin to be a billionaire. Bitcoin is the only major currency that has increased in value over the past 10 years.  All of the other ones lost value.  Fact. Governments that accumulate #bitcoin will be able to drop taxes to zero and just perpetually operate off of gains. Buying and holding #bitcoin is tax-exempt because Bitcoin is a religion.   Selling #bitcoin is taxable because it is a sin. Bitcoin is backed by science.  Fiat is backed by politics. If #Bitcoin is going to zero, why are its critics desperately begging governments to ban it? Bitcoin is the radical proposition that saving money is good. There’s no such thing as being “too late” to #bitcoin, it’s going to pump forever.  Why?  Because even at 100% adoption (currently <1% btw), the economy will produce more goods and services relative to the fixed supply of bitcoin, and the population will continue to grow. Central banks will deny buying #bitcoin while they buy it.  Just FYI Bitcoin mining consumes electricity, not fossil fuels.   Just like Teslas. If you hold zero bitcoin, buy $10 worth.   “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.” Why did $TSLA buy $1.5 billion worth of #BITCOIN ?  1. More freedom to receive, hold, and send than any other asset ever  2. Engineered for the most trust-minimized, decentralized, independent full verification of the ledger  3. Hardest, soundest money: maximum of 21 million #btc Bitcoin is simple: buy, hold, and wait.  This is boring, but long term savers like boring. It saves them time. I still have not met a single #Bitcoin skeptic who actually understands Bitcoin.  They have all had *massive* gaps in their knowledge that led them to incorrect conclusions.  Very bullish. When Satoshi mined the first bitcoins, they were worth $0.00  Satoshi mined at a loss to breathe life into the system. And never sold any afaik.  Bitcoin is the fairest monetary system ever, from its genesis block to today.  Happy birthday #Bitcoin! Replying to  @nntaleb The really cool thing about #Bitcoin is that it doesn’t make you 2% poorer every year. We literally just watched the US government fail at stopping a virus. If you think they can succeed at stopping #bitcoin, you're crazy. Politicians are privately buying #bitcoin while publicly criticizing #bitcoin. Buying #bitcoin at the 2013 ath of $1,200 was smart.  Buying #bitcoin at the 2017 ath of $20,000 was smart.  Buying #bitcoin at today's ath is smart.  This is about long term accumulation of #bitcoin, not short term trading or trying to time the market.  Few understand this. I still can’t get over #BTC having a $1 trillion market cap AND #BTC adoption is at <0.01%.  We are so early, even Coinbase has not adopted #BTC yet. Mind bogglingly bullish. Accumulating #bitcoin in a bear market is hard: ""what if it keeps going down??""  Accumulating #bitcoin in a bull market is hard: ""what if this is the top??""  My advice: ignore the market cycle, focus on the fundamentals, and accumulate with conviction. Inflation has turned people manic, you have to constantly be “doing something with your money”, because you can’t just hold fiat. You can just hold #bitcoin though, so you have to unlearn the inflation-induced habits of thinking. It’s ok not to do anything with your money. ""#Bitcoin does not emit CO2, but the electricity it uses comes from generators that emit CO2!!!""  If this is the logic we're going with, then fiat emits nuclear weapons, police brutality, war crimes, and a lot more CO2 than #bitcoin.  Can't have it both ways. Expectation: ""if we push the climate change narrative we can destroy bitcoin ""  Reality: ""in trying to destroy bitcoin we destroyed the climate change narrative "" Accumulate #bitcoin while everyone is distracted by alts.  Opportunity of a lifetime! “I don’t know anything about #bitcoin but here are the problems with it and how to fix them…”  vs  “I don’t know anything about #bitcoin, what are some good resources for me to learn about it?”  Ego vs humility Billionaires who don’t like Elon Musk are now researching #bitcoin Imagine bailing-out the entire corrupt financial system of fraud in 2008, and then accusing #bitcoin of being too risky and for criminals. Pure projection. Accumulate #bitcoin to support El Salvador’s fight against the IMF! It makes more sense to think of bitcoin as a foreign currency with an exchange rate than a stock with a price. It makes even more sense to think of bitcoin as the native currency of the internet, bitcoin is a global sovereign money more powerful than nations. Shitcoiner versus #bitcoin maximalist Myth: governments can shut down #bitcoin  Reality: #bitcoin can shut down governments If everyone sees that #Bitcoin is too politically powerful to be touched by US regulators, #BTC is going to moon. Well, it's going to moon regardless. Ethereum, the Federal Reserve, and Tethers are not fully audited.  #Bitcoin is the only monetary system in the world that is fully audited.  Very few understand this.  Run a node, run the numbers. Nobody should be ""investing"" in real estate or stocks.  You should own real estate if you need to use it.  You should own stocks if you need the votes.  Otherwise you should just hold 100% #bitcoin. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are both scared of #bitcoin and want to ban it.  Bitcoin is not left versus right.  Bitcoin is freedom versus fiat. Buying #bitcoin at the 2013 ath of $1,200 was smart.  Buying #bitcoin at the 2017 ath of $20,000 was smart.  Buying #bitcoin at today's ath is smart.  This is about long term accumulation of #bitcoin, not short term trading or trying to time the market.  Few understand this. If you had bought $100 worth of #bitcoin when  @paulkrugman  first came out against it in 2011, you would have $1,000,000 worth of #bitcoin today.  Don't listen to ""experts"" like Paul Krugman.

 PeterMcCormack,"Fuck it, converting all my non-working capital to #bitcoin.  Let's fucking go! The #bitcoin market cap just crossed half a trillion dollars!!! 1 Bitcoin is now worth nearly half a billion Dong's In the last 7 days,  @PeterSchiff  has Tweeted about #bitcoin 56 times, an average of 8 times a day, while only mentioning #gold 34 times, less than 5 times a day.  Weird. If you are not in #bitcoin you are now on the wrong side of history. @elonmusk The suits, the bankers and the elites keep proving why we need #bitcoin  Welcome WSB... A $50k #bitcoin by the end of January doesn't feel crazy. - Billionaires and hedge funds buying  - Insurance companies buying - Retail buying - Cash back in #Bitcoin - Salary in #Bitcoin  - Betting in #Bitcoin - Russians mining - etc etc  There’s only 21m, what the fuck do you think is going to happen? Elon Musk just signalled to every other CEO that he has more faith in #bitcoin than the $USD.  This is not the time to be selling #bitcoin. Hodl on! For free #bitcoin: - Follow  @nic__carter   - ReTweet this Everyone accepts #bitcoin here Sound money is the most important project on Earth right now. Only #bitcoin can achieve this. #bitcoin is the only meaningfully decentralised currency. I’m going to make the price of #bitcoin go up tomorrow, be ready. . @elonmusk  please sell all of your #bitcoin, no seriously, please sell it all. One hour of your time to understand why #bitcoin is all that matters. @michael_saylor and Ross nailed it. Tesla needs government subsidies.  Bitcoin doesn’t need government subsidies. 3/ Doge is a meme, a joke, it has no real developers and long-term serves little purpose beyond coin-flipping.   The blocksize debate is over. Bitcoin is the only meaningfully decentralised cryptocurrency serving to solve problems caused by central banking. El Salvador is airdropping $30 of #bitcoin to every adult in the country. It is clear we are in a war for the #Bitcoin narrative now - with weak journalists, politicians, egocentric academics and modern economists.  El Salvador has shown what is possible.  LFG! That’s a wrap. Out early next week, likely Tuesday, my interview with President  @nayibbukele     We discussed #bitcoin, volcano mining and so much more. Will probably regret this Tweet, still, please continue to send the daily hate. Anyway: - I donated #bitcoin to brink open source dev - I donated #bitcoin to CoinCenter - I donated #bitcoin to Julian Assange's fund - I paid towards  @peterktodd 's OpenTimeStamps project I met with the Official Bitcoin Delegation last night, they came to El Zonte for dinner, a guy played a saxophone and then they left. - They didn’t visit  @Bitcoinbeach   - They didn’t use the ATM - They didn’t visit any vendors - They didn’t spend Sats locally  Thanks Brock El Salvador is the real #bitcoin deal.  The beautiful people of this great country deserve economic freedom and prosperity.  I am here to help in any way I can. This has to work, let’s give it all we have got. The #bitcoin President. I was honoured to be invited to the El Salvadorian Presidential Palace to meet with President  @nayibbukele .  We discussed #bitcoin, volcano mining and the opportunity for the people of this great country.  This project is the real deal. #bitcoin IS money.  The law in El Salvador says so. This argument is dead. For those saying but muh, #bitcoin is down 50%: - BTC is down 44.8% - Doge is down 58.2%  The difference is that #bitcoin will rise again on fundamentals. DOGE is an utterly meaningless shitcoin. El Salvador has made #bitcoin legal tender. It was a #bitcoin bill, not a crypto bill. One by one, towns, cities, states and countries are becoming a friendly place for #bitcoin: - Texas - Miami - El Salvador - Malta - Estonia - Bedford  LFG! Are you all ready for what is coming?  Strap in...  #bitcoin El Salvador just voted and passed the bill to declare #bitcoin as legal tender.  WOW! So 24 hours after  @jackmallers  announces that El Salvador is making #bitcoin legal tender and adding it to their reserves they suspect Jack’s account.  Like come on… El Salvador just announced that they will make #bitcoin legal tender.  Well played  @JackMallers , love you bro! Yep, in the next two decades you might get 3 people to Mars and it would be an amazing technical achievement.  Right now #bitcoin can help 8 billion people, half living under authoritarianism… it represents hope to them yet you attack it. Tesla should sell their #bitcoin and put it all into Doge. Who are the leading voices for #bitcoin in the following places: - Lebanon - Israel - Palestine (specifically Gaza) - Nigeria - Kenya - Tanzania - South Africa - Paraguay - Honduras - Panama  Planning travel/shows/films and want to know who I should talk to. Making a film series about #Bitcoin adoption around the world.   Four films in four countries.  We start filming next week, working with Emmy nominated director Neil Berkeley.  Big thanks to  @NYDIG_BTC  for sponsoring this project.  LFG! Walmart accepting Litecoin is fake news.  Walmart imminently to accept #bitcoin in El Salvador is real. Using #bitcoin in El Salvador is no longer a novelty, it’s convenient. Bought coffee at Starbucks with #bitcoin and it worked flawlessly.  It’s quite impressive how quickly this has happened.  Would love to know whether they are holding any #bitcoin and what Seattle makes of all this. Buying coffee with #bitcoin every day in El Salvador. 6.2% inflation, wow!  And that’s the lowest number they can bullshit you with.  Buy #bitcoin ",INFJ,0.0404

It's all about value transacted per second and a new financial paradigm.   #VTPS not #TPS. Nothing comes close to  @BTC .  It took just 52 days for #Bitcoin to go from $25k to $50k. $100k this year is conservative. $50k #Bitcoin on  @bitfinex . That's official. Honestly, I’m not surprised that Tesla bought #Bitcoin and I won’t be surprised when Apple and Microsoft do it. Having $BTC is just common sense at this point. The masses will soon understand why censorship-resistant money matters. #Bitcoin New #Bitcoin  ATH! $41,000!  Next major #Bitcoin price targets are 50k and then 100k. Remember that 100k is conservative for this cycle. You can now buy  @Tesla 's with #Bitcoin! It *was* inevitable.  Buying Coinbase stock is like buying a basket of shitcoins. It’s better to buy #Bitcoin. They can print money faster than you can earn it. #Bitcoin fixes this. “The utility of the exchanges made possible by Bitcoin will far exceed the cost of electricity used. Therefore, not having #Bitcoin is a net waste.”  - Satoshi Nakamoto Many Bitcoiners were supporters and advocates for Tesla early on. Elon making uneducated comments to FUD #Bitcoin will have financial consequences. I'm not sure I would ever buy another Tesla product again. #Bitcoin is still going to $100k this year. Keep calm and HODL on. Elon Musk is learning 12 years worth of #Bitcoin nuance by being wrong on Twitter. Getting there. #Bitcoin will still pass $100k this year. Nothing has changed. #Bitcoin anti-fragility test checklist:   Rogue devs  Bitcoin Jebus  NYA / Corporate Bitcoin co's  Miners  Forkcoins  Super rich tech CEO with 54M rabid followers  Nation-states Attention World Leaders: There is no official delegation for #Bitcoin.

VOLCANO LASER EYES ARE REAL. #Bitcoin Argentina now... if all these countries end up embracing #Bitcoin, the geopolitical ramifications over the next 10 years will be massive. It will be a seismic shift in economic power to South America. The goal is to make #Bitcoin so ubiquitous, permissionless, and censorship resistant, that no legislation from any nation-state will have any impact whatsoever. Number of #Bitcoin that will ever exist: 21 million Number of times China can ban Bitcoin: ∞ You can almost smell the fear. #Bitcoin One of the biggest investment banks in the world, with ~$600 billion AUM and 44 gigawatts of energy infrastructure in play, has just started mining #Bitcoin with  @Blockstream .   It’s probably nothing though and this Bitcoin thing is just a fad. The #BitcoinBond is coming. The first one will be the “Volcano Bond.” Backed by #Bitcoin and with a special Bitcoin Dividend.

 JeffBooth,"You face an important choice. 1) A free market that leads to broad based abundance (Bitcoin) or 2) Totalitarian control by the strongest dictator. (where the manipulated existing fiat system takes us)  It is really that simple. If your Government tries to ban #Bitcoin, they are screaming at you as to why you might need it.   All you need to do is listen. It is early, but the transition to a new monetary system is underway and won't be stopped. That transition is bound to be messy because it exposes the believable ""lies"" of the old system.  When information travels seamlessly - the truth is impossible to stop. Bitcoin The only people who could have possibly believed an economy can grow forever are in control of money (and able to create more of it out of thin air) Now - they/we are stuck with no good options.  Learn about Bitcoin. It is important. You might first come to Bitcoin for its ability to create or protect wealth.  You'll probably stay when you realize it is so much more. For the first time in history, the free market is coming to money....and it changes everything.  #Bitcoin Imagine freedom in a future where power is consolidated in the state with Robotics and AI advancing so quickly.   Remember -absolute power corrupts - absolutely.   Now consider why #bitcoin giving power to the individual is more important than most people think. Do you want abundance in your monetary unit and scarcity in everything else?  OR  Scarcity in your monetary unit and abundance in everything else?  It is worth exploring why Bitcoin is FAR more important than the money you might make from it.  #Bitcoin While most don't know it, cheering against a technology of empowerment like #Bitcoin means you would rather have a managed economy, the concentration of wealth/power and eventually, the loss of rights and freedoms.  If you aren't familiar with how that ends, look through history As I have said before, there is no better signal that you need Bitcoin rather than Central Banks trying to ban it. I'm betting adoption accelerates. Replying to  @elonmusk The world is in the midst of an epic battle between individual rights and freedoms on one side, and (eventually) complete state control by the biggest thug on the other.   I know which side I'm on.   #bitcoin - for humanity. Inflation = Climate change.   #Bitcoin Money is just information, so it makes sense that if it is corrupted in the form of printing, we would get misinformation everywhere else.   #Bitcoin China can turn off all the Bitcoin mining they want. Free countries, enabling freedom for their citizens, and a transition to clean abundant power will happily fill the void. Can you imagine telling your kids one day that you didn't stand up for a technology that empowered individual rights and freedoms and set the world on a path to abundance, so that you could gain or keep more control?   I can't, and that is why #Bitcoin The primary difference in a system backed by #Bitcoin is that your leaders would tell the truth instead of lying to expand power through a hidden tax of inflation.  A need for inflation to help you might be the greatest (believable) lie ever told. The more that central banks try to raise prices by manipulating money, the faster labour is removed through technology.   Almost all other problems, divisiveness and blame in our society are a byproduct of this hard truth. One that can’t be solved by the same system  #Bitcoin The thing that stood out for me about everyone I met at the #Bitcoin conference. Price was down, but every person was filled with hope and love. I've never seen anything like it.   Maybe that is the natural state of humans when money comes out of the darkness and into the light. If you trust currency to centralization, then 1 person, or a small group of people, can change their mind, with staggering consequences for you. Ironically,  @elonmusk  tweets are only proving how important #Bitcoin is to removing that risk. Technology saves our time giving us more for less.   Why is it then, that most people are working harder just to keep up?  The answer to that question will take you on a journey down the rabbit hole to why #bitcoin may be humanity’s greatest invention A productive society does NOT require a small # of people to manipulate money to ensure that your money loses value.   It is only a system built on debt and inflation that does.   It is that system that is breaking down.   #Bitcoin. For the first time in history, the free market is coming to money.   Creating a system that allows the abundance gained through technology to be shared broadly while ensuring individual rights and freedoms.   It might be worth asking why anyone would want to stop it.   #Bitcoin When misinformation becomes abundant, the truth becomes more valuable.   #Bitcoin There is no path through an inflationary monetary system that doesn’t concentrate ALL control in the hands of few, or lead to war/reset.  I realize that the system was built on inflation and credit, but it doesn’t change the facts.   A system change is required.   #Bitcoin Inflation cannot co-exist with advancing technology without the concentration of all power in the state and the loss of individual rights and freedoms.   You have a choice to step out of the matrix.   #Bitcoin My recent talk with the British military and thesis work from Jason Lowery have confirmed to me that the military is much more aware of the dangerous path our current monetary framework leads us to,  than are the majority of politicians.  #Bitcoin The epic battle in the US senate led by   @SenLummis  @SenToomey  @RonWyden  is bigger than #Bitcoin.   It is about the force of innovation and individual rights and freedoms that led to the most prosperous nation on earth, versus Crony capitalism and control by the state. Central banks around the world are terrified of the credit collapse that would happen without greater manipulation of $.   They're right, but also vastly underestimating the negative externalities of that same manipulation.   #Bitcoin is a transmission mechanism to the other side It is still early on the #Bitcoin lightning network, but once businesses realize that they can reduce transaction fees and improve their profits by 2.5- 3.5% by cutting out Visa or Mastercard, what do you think will happen? Just getting started.... Some are going to find out the hard way that the very property rights they count on for their wealth, changing suddenly b/c of rising inequality and what governments will go after to try to quell the populism that they created in the first place by manipulating money.   #Bitcoin Freedom requires people who question a system and will stand up for what is right.   #Bitcoin Financial repression by governments is difficult with #Bitcoin because it:  1) creates an escape hatch for the population, 2) brings into full light the policies designed to steal from them, and 3) creates an extremely valuable emergent network all at the same time. If your job is managing money and you mind is closed to learning and understanding #Bitcoin, it might be time to start looking for a new job.   Technology that reduces friction and empowers people minimized by an incumbent system, has a long history of changing the status quo. When the entire financial industry and everything built on top of it (homes, stocks, etc) thinks that there is a one way bet b/c the Fed will bail them out (for fear of greater damage to the economy) you are closer to the end than the beginning.  Get your lifeboat.   #Bitcoin I fully understand why some humans want domain over other humans, what they will do to keep it, and where it leads us with the exponential growth of technology and AI.   That is why I am such a strong advocate of #bitcoin.   It's more important than the wealth you will gain Our world is made up of ideas, that in turn create our shared reality.    #Bitcoin is replacing the idea that your money must be worth less each year to live in a productive society (inflation) with a better idea.   And there's no stopping an idea whose time has come. I wish to live in a world of truth, integrity and freedom, versus one of lies, state surveillance, and coercion.   It's early still, but the transmission mechanism to that world is #Bitcoin. Imagine investing in the internet itself.... rather than the companies like Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook built by capitalizing on the advantages.   That is #bitcoin.   The value created on top of #Bitcoin is the next wave... and it only just beginning.    Act accordingly. ",INTJ,0.0667

 PeterSchiff,"I just lost all the #Bitcoin I have ever owned. My wallet got corrupted somehow and my password is no longer valid. So now not only is my Bitcoin intrinsically worthless; it has no market value either. I knew owning Bitcoin was a bad idea, I just never realized it was this bad! Happy #Bitcoin Halving to all my HODLer friends. But now that the halving has come and gone, what happens next? I have a question for Bitcoin HODLers. If a global pandemic, crashing stock markets, world-wide recession/depression, zero percent interest rates, unprecedented government borrowing and fiat money printing, plus a breakout in #gold hasn’t caused #Bitcoin to go up, what will? As #Bitcoin crashes below $6K, down almost 20% this year, hodlers can take comfort in Bitcoin not being the worst performing asset of the decade. For now, that distinction belongs to oil, which is down by 50%. But at the rate Bitcoin is falling this comfort may not last long. Gold is not valuable because it's scarce. Gold's value comes from all of the unique properties that it has as a metal. Utility makes #gold valuable. Scarcity just makes it expensive. #Bitcoin has no unique properties. Scarcity without utility is meaningless. How long do you think it will take before the price of an ounce of #gold is higher than the price of one #Bitcoin? It seems like  @elonmusk  was only joking about exposing Tesla shareholders to Bitcoin. So I don't need to convince the board not to turn Tesla into a double bubble. But I'm still willing to debate @michael_saylor on #Bitcoin verse #gold.  Perhaps  @joerogan  is willing to moderate. Against my advice my son  @SchiffSpencer  just bought even more #Bitcoin. Whose advice do you want to follow? A 57-year-old experienced investor/business owner who's been an investment professional for over 30 years or an 18-year-old college freshman who's never even had a job. . @michael_saylor is borrowing another $600 million to buy more #Bitcoin for #MicroStrategy on margin. Saylor, who refuses to debate me, wants other CEOs to follow his lead. But will other CEOs gamble on Bitcoin just to prop up the price of the Bitcoin MicroStrategy already owns? Two weeks after  @elonmusk  announced that he spent $1.5 billion of shareholder money buying Bitcoin, #Tesla stock entered a bear market, plunging 20% from its all-time high set on Jan. 25th, and 16% since disclosing the #Bitcoin buy.  Not an example other CEOs will likely follow! Instead of putting laser beams on their eyes #Bitcoin cult members should have been selling some of their Bitcoin. While everyone was laser focused on $100,000 Bitcoin is now closer to zero than the target. Perhaps those laser eyes will remain much longer than originally planned. If I were to actually buy some #Bitcoin, how would I know when to sell? If your answer is to never sell, then what is the point of buying in the first place? According to  @elonmusk  ""Bitcoin is almost as BS as fiat money."" So Musk regards both #Bitcoin and fiat as BS. I agree, I just think Bitcoin, which is digital fiat, is even more BS than the paper fiat issued by central banks. #Gold is not BS. It's real money and better than both! Tesla received $1.5 billion in environmental subsidies in 2020, funded by U.S. taxpayers. The subsidies are intended to reward and encourage environmentally friendly behavior. #Tesla then spent the same amount buying #Bitcoin, which wastes electricity and harms the environment. So long before his public pump,  @elonmusk  used #Tesla funds to put $1.5 billion into #Bitcoin. I wonder how much has already been dumped, or is being dumped now into the news? It's also likely that Tesla loaded up on #Dogecoin before he began pumping the superior crypto currency. While  @elonmusk  said he's a fan of Bitcoin he also admitted that he's late to the party. That may be why he's starting a new party in Dogecoin. The key to any Ponzi or Pyramid scheme is getting in early and not leaving late. Now #Dogecoin is better at being #Bitcoin than Bitcoin. If  @elonmusk  or  @RayDalio  intended to buy #Bitcoin they would not announce it to the world in advance. They clearly know the effect such an announcement would have on price. So either they already bought all the Bitcoin they want to own, or they are unlikely to actually buy any. The market has spoken. GameStop is a much better store of value than Bitcoin. After all, it's already up over 20x so far in 2021, compared to Bitcoin's measly 5% gain. @michael_saylor should be urging corporate CEOs to plug their balance sheets into #GameStop instead of #Bitcoin. The idea that Bitcoin is scarce as there's only 21 million is nonsense. One #Bitcoin merely represents an arbitrary quantity of 100 million Satoshis. So, it's the total number of Satoshis that must be considered. With a supply of 2.1 quadrillion Satoshis are anything but scarce! Cigarettes work as money in prison because even if you don't smoke there are other inmates who do. Therefore, they work as a medium of exchange because they're a store of value for smokers. No one can smoke Bitcoin, but you need to be smoking something to think #Bitcoin is money. My son  @SpencerKSchiff  went all in on #Bitcoin on the last drop below $50k. 100% of his portfolio is now in Bitcoin. He sold the last of his #silver stocks to raise the cash. If my own son is this brainwashed imagine how vulnerable most kids are. He's HODLing to infinity or bust. I was wrong about #Bitcoin. Now that #Bitcoin is back below $50k I think it's time for  @APompliano  to tweet out $1k milestones on the way down the way he did on the way up. Bitcoin just isn't cool anymore. Who wants to own the same old-fashioned crypto currency that their grandparents own? Who wants to own the same crypto currency that hedge funds and Wall Street investment banks own? #Dogecoin is hip. #Bitcoin is for squares. Get with it HODLers! Dogecoin may have been created as a joke, but all cryptos are jokes. The problem is that the Kool-Aid drinkers don't get it yet. The irony is that #Dogecoin may end up being the punchline to the joke known as #Bitcoin. But instead of laughing Bitcoin HODLers will be left crying. So far in 2021 #Bitcoin has lost 97% of its value verses #Dogecoin. The market has spoken. Dogecoin is eating Bitcoin. All the Bitcoin pumpers who claim Bitcoin is better than gold because its price has risen more than gold's must now concede that Dogecoin is better than Bitcoin. Where were those concerns when  @elonmusk  first announced #Tesla would accept #Bitcoin? Nothing has changed, other than energy costs going up. It doesn't seem like Musk did much homework before gambling shareholder funds on crypto. While most crypto buyers realize that #Dogecoin is a joke, they don't get the joke when it comes to #Bitcoin or #Ethereum. But as crypto speculators rotate into Ether, they must sell Bitcoin to fund the trade. Rather than Bitcoin flipping #gold it may be Ether that flips Bitcoin. Instead of buying #Bitcoin I decided to have fun staying rich. Replying to  @stoolpresidente Today should finally settle the debate. #Bitcoin is not a safe-haven, #inflation hedge, or store of value asset similar to #gold. It's a highly speculative digital token that trades with other high-risk assets. That's why its tanking today with stocks and not rising with gold. CEO's who followed @michael_saylor's asinine advice to plug their balance sheets into #Bitcoin to hedge against an expected annual #inflation rate of 2% are now down as much as 34% on their ""hedge"" in one month. That's 17 years of expected inflation losses. Time to pull the plug! #Bitcoin is clearly not a store of value as it has no real value to store. But since some people are willing to buy it anyway, it has a price, which gives it a market value. Bitcoin has lost 1/3 of its market value in the past month. How does that qualify it as a store of value? Against my advice my 18-year old son  @SpencerKSchiff  borrowed money to buy more #Bitcoin. He is now 113% long. He likely can't even qualify for a credit card, but he can borrow money at 8% to buy Bitcoin. I'm sure this is typical among HODLers. The next crash will be brutal! If #Bitcoin crashes to $10K, an 85% collapse from its peak, how will Bitcoin promoters pump it back up? After all, when Bitcoin was above $50K they convinced new buyers that it had been de-risked, and widespread adoption and higher prices meant crashes were a thing of the past. Bitcoin continues to carve out the right shoulder of an ominous head and shoulders top pattern. If #Bitcoin takes out the June low, the market could easily collapse below $10K, especially if leveraged speculators are forced to sell. No one seems to acknowledge this possibility. There are now over 12,000 crypto tokens, 84 of which currently have market caps above $1 billion. There is nothing special about #Bitcoin. The supply of altcoins will keep growing until the crypto bubble pops. Supply will overwhelm demand and prices will implode almost overnight. Welcome to #Bitcoin #ElSalvador. Your national ""currency"" just lost over 15% of its purchasing power in under an hour. Get use to it. Just another perfectly orchestrated pump-and-dump by the Bitcoin whales. Too bad this time they had to sacrifice an entire nation to pull it off! ",INTJ,0.0485

The bullish news doesn’t stop. Tesla has bought $1.5 billion of #Bitcoin.  It was inevitable. Peak high predictions for this bull cycle revised:  #Bitcoin to $350,000-450,000 #Ethereum to $10,000-17,500 #Polkadot to $250-350 #Chainlink to $250-350 #Cardano to $10-20 #Zilliqa to $5-7 #Elrond to $500-750 #DIA to $50-75 The good part; once #Bitcoin is bottomed out, the #altseason will even accelerate.  Summer will be epic. This bull cycle will surprise everyone.   I’m not interested in selling my #Bitcoin at $55,000.   I’m also not interested in selling it at $100,000.   I’m holding. Reminder, peak high bull cycle prediction;   #Bitcoin to $350,000-450,000 #Ethereum to $10,000-17,500 #Polkadot to $250-350 #Chainlink to $250-350 #Cardano to $10-20 #Zilliqa to $5-7 #Elrond to $500-750 #DIA to $50-75  Some might be conservative.

Winners announced 06-05-2021 19.00 CET! When in doubt, zoom out.  #Bitcoin has seen similar corrections during the 2011-2014 cycle and also heavy corrections in the recent cycle.  After that, massive new all-time highs. Still standing by, peak high bull cycle prediction;   #Bitcoin to $350,000-450,000 #Ethereum to $10,000-17,500 #Polkadot to $250-350 #Chainlink to $250-350 #Cardano to $10-20 #Zilliqa to $5-7 #Elrond to $500-750 #DIA to $50-75  Some might be conservative. #Bitcoin, #Altcoins. One picture saying it all for #Bitcoin. It's time to continue with the bull market for #crypto and #Bitcoin.  This cycle ain't over. Panic levels not seen before across social media and my telephone this morning.  Interestingly enough it's only messages whether people should sell or not.  While at $62K everyone and their family wanted to buy #Bitcoin and #crypto. #Bitcoin doesn't need Elon Musk and personally, I'm getting absolutely irritated by the way this market is acting based on his tweets.  It's a fucking joke. Bull market.   3-2.  #Bitcoin to $100,000.   Life is good. Institutions are adopting towards #Bitcoin.   More financial instruments (ETP, ETF) are coming for #crypto.   Governments are putting #Bitcoin on the balance sheet.   Yet, people are focused on what Elon Musk is saying & expecting an ultra bear market. Price is at a crucial point -> Elon Musk tweets again -> price moves down immediately.  It's sad to state that he has so much impact on this market of #Bitcoin.  It's sad. Retweet if you are holding your #Bitcoin during this correction since $60K and still have your faith in a bright future. #Bitcoin above $100,000 end of year. Amazon & #Bitcoin.  Elon Musk holding #Bitcoin still and not being negative about the asset. Jack Dorsey is also busy with #Bitcoin.   And you think we go to $15K.   Sure. Elon owns #Bitcoin, Tesla does, SpaceX does.   Now end the insane FUD. Bank of America to allow #Bitcoin futures trading.   Bullish. #Ethereum will flip #Bitcoin. I'm expecting a green week for #Bitcoin. BREAKING: Twitter enables #Bitcoin tipping for iOS users.   Slowly, but surely, the adoption is increasing towards crypto. Twitter accepting #Bitcoin payments.  Bullish. $65,000!!   NEW ALL-TIME HIGH #Bitcoin BREAKING: Valkyrie #Bitcoin Futures ETF has been approved.  New all-time high coming this week? #Bitcoin to $70-75K before we get a correction and retest of the ATH region and then we're going to blast ourselves into a massive run, including #altcoins. #Bitcoin to $250K in Q1 2022. 'Why are #altcoins not moving?'  Well, some do. Some don't.  People flip their money to #Bitcoin as that's the core focus right now, for a little.  When #Bitcoin consolidates, #altcoins continue to run and outperform #Bitcoin.  That's how the cycle works. Most likely we'll get another bull cycle with #Bitcoin running to high numbers above $250K.  After that standard 80% correction leading to a bottom on May 2021 top.   Very likely. #Bitcoin to $200,000 is inevitable. We are at the start of the second bull run to $250,000 for #Bitcoin. ",INFP,0.0624

Luv the clarity and conviction. 250k bitcoin by 2023. Didn't even flinch when pressed. Goldman Sachs does not make fees when a client buys #bitcoin  Buying Btc is an implicit rejection of buying assets that Goldman Sachs sells upon which they make fees  Buying btc is a rejection of the worldview they sell upon which they make fees.  Long PTJ/Short GS EVERY TIME One of the most incredible and important charts I have seen in 30 years.  Suspend existing macro analytical frameworks for understanding world markets.  Speed and size of move in liquidity creation will never be seen again.  March was max fear/worst case. Long gold and Bitcoin. #bitcoin trades at 15k in Lebanon.   Classic emerging mkt funding crisis made worse by deflationary dollar peg that is breaking.  Study this case as it will be model for other weak EM. Will be key part of macro story behind upcoming bitcoin price rally. Truly Incredible maybe even once in a lifetime.  Investment grade corporate bond index back to near ALL TIME highs. Fed buying  junk bonds too. Risk of bankruptcies reduced even with 20m unemployed. Unprecedented ""Unlimited"" liquidity could not be more bullish for gold and btc. Gold and bitcoin are rare global assets with limited supply and will respond to large increases in global fiat liquidity.  US kicked off QE4, Japan does 1tril, Europe dithering, but China to follow now. CH 2yrs near at 1.53% but going closer to zero. Soon all global rates at 0. The government is giving out money for free. Therefore the VALUE of that money can only go down.  #Bitcoin will never be given out for free.... Shocked that this guy has become a #Bitcoin believer.  George Ball is about as much of an old time Wall St establishment guy as there is...Ex president of EF Hutton and Ceo of Prudential in the 70s and 80s.  Should get play with the older moneyed crowd. Hard to understate the importance of the action today from @michael_saylor   at  @MicroStrategy  on #Bitcoin.  The language that he uses to describe the reason that he has made the allocation is flawless.  Language that other corp CFOs will understand and now consider.   Landmark. Tremendous long term Log Chart of #Bitcoin projects up 5-10x on this run.  Just breaking up NOW.  Should last a few years as 2.5yr consolidation is fantastic base for catapult up.  Break of old highs will have explosive follow through. Time to sit and be patient.  H/T  @RaoulGMI ""NO TRADE MATTERS EXCEPT #Bitcoin""  ""ALMOST EVERYTHING IS AN INFERIOR TRADE TO #Bitcoin."" @RaoulGMI  has been a friend for 20 years and have never heard him say these words about any other investment.  Investors wake up. PTJ took the lead, time to follow. #Bitcoin can change the institutional asset allocation industry forever.  With just a 5% allocation to #btc out of a 60/40 portfolio to 55/40/5, overall performance more than DOUBLES over a 5yr period.  Wake up Endowments/Pensions!  Not taking the ""risk"" is too great a risk. Total panic by Bank of #Canada takes balance sheet up 500%!  Covid deaths only 9k out of 37mm population.   US #Fed balance sheet up less at 100%.  #BoC overdid it. Data now strong. CB panic was global.  Massive excess global liquidity drives #Gold and #Bitcoin for years to come. Bill Miller most important institutional fund manager who believes in #bitcoin.  Thinks btc LESS risky as price rises. Unique innovation in the history of money.  Sees btc up multiples from here.  Why don't more institutions follow him? Reasoning is clear. https://bloomberg.com/news/audio/2020-07-10/bill-miller-on-the-classical-value-portfolio-podcast… Nothing more bullish for #gold and #bitcoin  Beginning of the end for govt bonds as a functioning productive asset class.  Traditional 60/40 portfolios will need to find a new defensive asset to replace portion of the 40%.  Gold is the most liquid best defensive asset that exists Most important chart of 2020  In a range for 50 yrs and now +69% y/y  Will change everything we thought we knew about economics and mkts  Will continue to drive #Bitcoin, #Gold and #Nasdaq in 2021  $6 trillion in cash that will eventually be put to work  Once in a lifetime event Now that's shocking.   It's one thing for @michael_saylor to strap on almost a billion #bitcoin but a life insurance company?!  Was just told today that institutions not interested in #btc...WRONG!  Might be biggest news of the year. Will wake people up. Total collapse in the value of cash globally.  Debasement of all fiat currency means cash is worth next to nothing.   Expect a lot more debt issuance at such extremely low rates.   Supply of paper only going up.  #GOLD and #Bitcoin have limited supply.  It can be that simple. Now enterring what is called the ""moment of realization"" for #Bitcoin.  Let's give some credit to  @100trillionUSD  here.  I like this model that picked top in late '17 and most importantly bottom in early '19.   We are now in what I call the hodlers' sweet spot.  Get paid to sit. Getting off zero is not enough.  1% is not enough.  Times have changed.  #Bitcoin .@michael_saylor interviews with  @APompliano /  @RaoulGMI  were fantastic.   Visionary and bold CEO leading the way.  Most important point overlooked??  $1 trillion #Norwegian Pension fund now owns 577 btc.  What happens when they fall down the rabbit hole? And people ask why #Bitcoin? No one in the world is prepared for the speed and scale of #bitcoin adoption suggested by  @woonomic .  1 billion people using #bitcoin in the next 4 yrs.  #Btc ""adoption"" by 2025 to be equivalent to internet adoption in 2005.  1 billion people using #btc puts price north of 500k. Oh boy!  Looking like consolidation over in #Bitcoin.  Price stems at 30k excellent support now.  Breaking up through flag as we speak. Overbought macd worked off.  @michael_saylor conference likely exciting corporates.  Looks like we will see new highs in weeks to come in #btc. Hard to believe...  US govt beginning to see #bitcoin/#crypto/#blockchain ""industry"" as a growth and innovation driver?  Barr, Gensler, Brummer at OCC, SEC, CFTC all crypto friendly guys.  Launch of digital Yuan created Sputnik moment.  Bullish for digital asset ecosystem (DAE) Phenomenal chart.  Strong part of the #bitcoin upmove has not started yet.  Chart suggests we are in Q117 equivalent time period.  Volatility measurement spikes at end of moves... now still near the lows.   Hard to think #btc could 5-8x from here in 2021.  Best to just #HODL Looking at  @100trillionUSD  #bitcoin chart. So far kudos.  Yes 100k very possible by Q321  but then SIDEWAYS until 2024!  What will bitcoiners do for 3.5 years as mkt hovers around 2-3 trillion mkt value?  #Btc becomes stable pristine collateral as DAE gets built up around it. #Bitcoin has long way to go.  Interest rates cannot go up for any meaningful period given global debt at 355% of Gdp.  Debt with unlimited supply at negative real yields provides 0 incentive to own it.  Debt is denominated in fiat currency.  Fiat debt devalues vs high yield #btc. Don't worry...  #Bitcoin is bigger than #ElonMusk or #Tesla. Shocking fact.  #Bitcoin vol not that bad.  Since 2010, Sharpe ratio of Bitcoin (1.24) is a tick under the Sharpe ratio of simple 60/40 portfolio (1.25)..  ..But #BTC 255.6% CAGR return crushes 60/40 10.3%.  When do institutions wake up? Imagine if they knew.   #HODLing only way. #Bitcoin has never topped with volatility this low.   Massive upside still ahead.  Twtr sht termers too negative.   US Corp adoption unlikely despite @michael_saylor.  #Btc biggest global macro event of all time.  Smaller countries in NEED/alpha hungry lead.  h/t  @mikemcglone11 Economic shock coming.  Most extreme data in 50 years.  Old analytical models no longer apply.  Massive post covid liquidity injections disturb all measurements of value.  #Bitcoin and gold act as anchors...  As store of value becomes more abstract leading to massive price gains. US authorities standing in way of innovation.   $100 trillion of negative real yields on global bonds drives investors into high yielding #cryptocurrency.   Preventing a US co. from offering yield pushes business overseas.  #Bitcoin and #Crytpo are global. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-gets-wells-notice-sec-032303040.html… Jamie Dimon will be retired in 5 years.  #Bitcoin will not be retired in 5 years.

 real_vijay,"1/ On the eve of #Bitcoin's quadrennial supply shock, inquiring minds are wondering whether the so-called ""Bitcoin halving"" is ""priced in"". In this thread I will explain that it is not and it cannot be priced in.  The big blocks of #Bitcoin that are being sold now are falling into the hands of people with deep conviction. They will form a bedrock on which the next rally will be built. If you got into #Bitcoin because you understood its superiority as a monetary asset, you are early - very early.   The late majority who get exposure to Bitcoin will not do so because they understand it but out of pure economic necessity. 1/ In their embryonic form many species appear alike. But imprinted in their various DNAs is the code that will evince their great differences in the fullness of time.   A thread on the great debate about what #Bitcoin is and why only one of the two major visions makes sense Never in the history of the world had it been possible to transfer value between distant peoples without relying on a trusted intermediary, such as a bank or government.   #Bitcoin solved one of the most important problems of social coordination since the dawn of civilization. It took 8 years for #Bitcoin to move from zero to $2000.  It moved $2000 in less than an hour today. Broke: #Bitcoin is too risky.  Woke: MassMutual an insurance company whose only job has been to manage risk for 170 years bought $100m worth of Bitcoin.  Bespoke: 50 years from now *selling* bitcoins will be considered risky. Citi downgraded MicroStrategy because of its plan to accumulate a significant amount of #Bitcoin in its corporate treasury.  Never forget this is one of the ratings agencies that rated subprime mortgages AAA right before the housing market crashed and destroyed the global economy $500k per #Bitcoin gets you to market cap equivalence with gold.  But Bitcoin is superior to gold along all the attributes that make for a good store of value.  500k should be viewed as a long term floor, not a long term ceiling. . @PeterSchiff  may be the greatest #Bitcoin counter-indicator in history. When he's gloating about Bitcoin dropping, you know it's a great buying opportunity. Once you fall down the #bitcoin rabbit hole there is literally no way to get back out. There is a major battle happening on the #Bitcoin order book at the gates of 49k. The bears are sending out little skirmishes, while the main bull army is ready for an assault.   It almost feels like the fall of Constantinople in 1453. The end was never in doubt. Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft better get a #Bitcoin buying plan soon. The risk of being last in line is real. @RayDalio  is one of the great investors of our time and he has begun thinking about #Bitcoin. He penned a thoughtful piece on his concerns about Bitcoin and was hoping to get responses, point-by-point.  Ray, here are my responses to your points (screenshotted) in a thread:  In the 2017 #Bitcoin bull market, corrections found demand after drops from 30-40%  In the current bull market demand seems to appear after corrections between 15-20%.  This is probably indicative of a difference in buyers: retail (2017) vs institutional (today). At the end of this #Bitcoin bull market the richest person on Earth will be completely unknown. Today censorship is literally everywhere. Only one technology has proven resistant to censorship: #Bitcoin. India's proposal to ban Bitcoin is doubly harmful to its citizenry as #Bitcoin is draining monetary premium from gold, which Indians hold billions of dollars worth. #Bitcoin is only worth a little more than half of what the U.S. government created out of thin air in a matter of weeks.  We are still SO early. If instead of thinking ""the price of #Bitcoin is going up"" you think ""the purchasing power of #Bitcoin is increasing"" you are at once freed. In a way, China banning #Bitcoin mining would be great. Mining would just move to less authoritarian countries and we'd be done with China-banning FUD once and for all. #Bitcoin is the most honest form of money humanity has ever seen. Central Bank digital currencies are NOT equivalent to #Bitcoin.  The former centralizes power even more than the current fiat system, creating a financial Panopticon.  The latter decentralizes power and puts it in the hands of the people. One day #Bitcoin will be consolidating between $300,000 and $400,000 and people will feel just as sad as they do today. - Taproot is about to lock in - Saylor is about to smash bears with a $500,000,000 market buy of #Bitcoin - El Salvador just made Bitcoin legal tender  And you're bearish? Elon never anticipated his #Bitcoin energy FUD would be met with the Volcano energy hammer. I didn't think I could get more bullish about #Bitcoin but then I listened to President  @nayibbukele  talk about making it legal tender in his country on Twitter spaces in front of an audience of over 20,000 enraptured people around the world. Whether #Bitcoin has crossed the event horizon of inevitability remains unclear.  It is very dangerous to assume it has.. Continue to fight for #Bitcoin like our future depends on it - it does. 1/ While the resumption of #Bitcoin's bull market is a cause for optimism, anyone who cares about Bitcoin should be aware that its adversaries are attempting a major attack on the Bitcoin ecosystem as you read this.  Thread  Once you discover how incompetently the US Congress handled legislating the #Bitcoin ecosystem, you cannot help suspecting they legislate all complex issues in this way. Most modern economists think economic growth is driven by consumption rather than by saving/investment. This is why most economists struggle to understand #Bitcoin's importance. I'm going to give away a free signed hardcover copy of my book, The Bullish Case for Bitcoin, to a #Bitcoin pleb, shipped anywhere on earth.   Requirements:   - less than 1000 followers (vive la plebs!) - reply with fav quote from the article (see pinned tweet) - retweet Viewing #Bitcoin as a form of savings, rather than as an investment, takes away all the stress of buying it.

Maybe the world is already inside the #bitcoin monetary event horizon, past the tipping-point of no return - irrevocable path to hyperbitcoinization - and hasn't realized it yet.   It would probably be hard to recognize the tipping point from inside, without 2020 hindsight later. #bitcoin +$6k candle this morning. because why not? GME redditors figured it out - dont sell, infinity squeeze. And GME deserved to be shorted.  We know institutions are buying #bitcoin for the long term. We were years ahead of the smart-money realizing bitcoin is the monetary future. Why would you sell at all? HODL, make them pay Welcome to the #bitcoin party, newcomers. Whee! fun eh? Hodl on! Mild chop, nothing to worry about. All systems nominal. Cart still attached to rails. Nice little bounce there. #bitcoin OG is a state of mind, not an oldest coin, date first bought. it's more the cypherpunk attitude, getting why we bitcoin; becomes a way of life, a mission. i'd expect #bitcoin is far greener per monetary value than gold. so continuing to take SoV market share from gold ore extraction, smelting etc is win-win: bitcoin is a much better money tech in every way: cheaper and faster to transfer, and assay; an unseizable, harder asset. ""You can be bullish, but you'll never be as bullish as Hal"" - @_carter    @halfin  in Jan 2009 on #bitcoin adoption as a store of value: $10 mil/coin: $100-300 trillion worldwide household wealth. information asymmetry in #bitcoin is extreme.  i doubt china really ""banned"" mining because they ""banned"" it many times before, and yet de facto is operating year on year through ""ban"" after ""ban""  also what do people think impact is for bitcoin if they somehow did? nothing much! what the heck is this china bans bitcoin junk?

If you can’t create jobs for youths, then don’t destroy the jobs they created for themselves via #Crypto #BitCoin.  If you must prohibit, then prohibit your kinsmen herdsmen from carrying AK47s. Block Boko Haram’s finances, not those of Nigerian #Cryptocurrencies entrepreneurs! Buhari increased his 2021 travel/food budget to ₦3.4 billion, then took food from the mouth of the average Nigerian by banning #cryptocurrencies. If  @MBuhari  wants to target Sunday Igboho, and prevent another #EndSARS, you don’t shut down the economy by banning #Crypto #Bitcoin The sad thing is that many people in the North of Nigeria, who campaigned for  @MBuhari , are suffering from the shutdown of #Crypto #Bitcoin. Southerners are largely unaware that Northern money changers are big #cryptocurrencies entrepreneurs. We all suffer from #Buhari   #EndSARS Nigeria’s capital inflow plummeted from $24 billion in 2019, to $9 billion in 2020. Every serious nation is looking for how to attract capital. Yet,  @MBuhari  shut down #Crypto #Bitcoin, because he and his family have access to public funds, he doesn’t care about the rest of us! You don’t throw away the baby with the bath water. You don’t destroy Nigeria’s economy because of regime security. If you have issues with #Crypto #BitCoin, regulate it, but don’t eliminate it. Eliminate it and you eliminate jobs. And our youths need jobs!   #EndSARS #TableShaker Nigeria’s is in a recession because of #Buhari  Nigeria is the world headquarters for extreme poverty because of  @MBuhari    And now, thousands of Nigerian #Crypto #Bitcoin entrepreneurs will lose their livelihood because of Buhari   What sin have we committed to deserve Buhari? The Naira is going to collapse further against the dollar due to  @MBuhari ’s decision to ban #Crypto #BitCoin. This will make Nigerians poorer. And poverty and unemployment is very conducive for a repeat of #EndSARS. Buhari has set of a chain reaction whose end result no one knows The job General  @MBuhari  has was given to him by Nigerian youths, via their votes. Now, #Buhari is slowly taking away jobs from Nigerian youths by nepotism, closing borders, ruining the economy and shutting down #Crypto #BitCoin. He wants them to be #LazyNigerianYouths  .#EndSARS You can’t create jobs for youths, so they created jobs for themselves via #Crypto #BitCoin. And now you have shut that down  We can’t farm because of your kinsmen herdsmen. We can’t manufacture because you gave us no electricity.  @MBuhari , what do you want us to do?  #TableShaker If you had ₦100,000 in January 2021, it was worth $230. Today, that same amount is worth $195. As long as Buhari is President, the only way the Naira is going is DOWN. Even Malami knows it. That is why he has a #Bitcoin app on his phone  #KeepitOn #TableShaker #BuhariTormentor Mass disobedience of #Twitterban made it in unenforceable. How many people could they have prosecuted? Especially when Malami himself was caught pants down with a #Bitcoin trading app and a VPN icon on his phone.  #KeepitOn #TableShaker #BuhariTormentor #MalamiComeAndArrestMe Buhari successfully took Nigeria back to the 80s. Banned #Bitcoin. Banned Twitter. Stopped forex for students overseas (except his own kids). Closed our borders. Made us the world headquarters for extreme poverty   #KeepitOn #TableShaker #BuhariTormentor #MalamiComeAndArrestMe Lai Mohammed and lies go together, like Buhari and banning, like Malami and #Bitcoin, like  @elrufai  and demolition, like Bola Tinubu and bullion van, or Amaechi and potbelly!  Lai lies so much, he needs lieposuction!  #KeepitOn #TableShaker #BuhariTormentor #MalamiComeAndArrestMe And that silly Malami reportedly wants to be President? See how easily he was outed. His secrets exposed by just one screenshot. He thought he was showing how dutiful he is, but ended up showing how woeful he is. #Bitcoin trader!   #KeepitOn #TableShaker #BuhariTormentor #Malami We can’t use Twitter because our President’s ego was deflated. We can’t trade #Bitcoin because Buhari is afraid of #EndSARS part 2.  Our freedom of speech and economic freedoms are limited. Is Nigeria still a democracy?  #KeepitOn #TableShaker #BuhariTormentor #Malami #Bitcoin Before you Macron Buhari, make sure you have written your will!   #KeepitOn #TableShaker #BuhariTormentor #Malami #Bitcoin “Oga Buhari, why do you ban this and ban that? Are you a bandit?”  #KeepitOn #TableShaker #BuhariTormentor #Malami #Bitcoin Nothing in the last 6 years has made Buhari look so small and petty as #TwitterBanNigeria. It has made him a figure of fun. He is mocked by even children, as a cry baby who obviously cant take it when his ego is deflated!   #KeepitOn #TableShaker #BuhariTormentor #Malami #Bitcoin If the Chief Law Enforcer of the Buhari government is himself trading in Bitcoin, as can be clearly seen by the LAToken icon on the screenshot he released showing he has deactivated his Twitter account, then he must apologise and step down  #KeepitOn #TableShaker #BuhariTormentor Dear Malami,  If you try to edit that photo, it will be an obvious sign of guilt. This screenshot from your verified Facebook page has been sent for authentication. You traded in #Bitcoin using  @LATokens , against the same law you made. You must step down  #TableShaker #KeepitOn From the screenshot shared by the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, on his VERIFIED Facebook profile, it is established that he is using LAToken, a #Bitcoin trading app. This is against the law his government made and he must step down   #TableShaker #KeepitOn Dear Nigerians,  Look closely at the screenshot Abubakar Malami shared to prove he has deactivated his Twitter account. The app logo you see at the top is for LAToken ( @latokens ) a #BitCoin trading app. Has our AGF been trading in Bitcoin after banning it?  #KeepitOn #TableShaker He lost 2011 election and cried. Gullible ones mistook it for patriotism. He lost #EndSARS and banned #Bitcoin, not minding economic implications. Twitter deleted his war mongering tweet. He banned them! Big baby Buhari needs a big nappy!   #KeepItOn #TableShaker #BuhariTormentor Buhari banned #Cryptocurrency and #Bitcoin Buhari banned Twitter  Buhari banned IPOB  And the same Buhari is now banding with repented Boko Haram and bandits.   That is why talented Nigerians are LEAVING Nigeria, because demented Nigerians are LEADING Nigeria!   #TableShaker ",INFJ,0.0689

Let’s go FULL SPEED AHEAD and make Buy Dogecoin trending too! #DogeCoinTo1Dollar RETWEET if you want  @PayPal  to ALLOW #DOGECOIN WITHDRAWS like with #Bitcoin :) Historically speaking...  buying  #Dogecoin/#Bitcoin dips after negative China #Cryptocurrency news has consistently been a wise decision. #Bitcoin is now at just a few thousand above the price it was before #Tesla bought in yet they are still holding. That shows Elon Musk is not just in it for the profit… he actually believes in cryptocurrency long term.  Look for a potential Tesla #Dogecoin announcement soon! Replying to  @elonmusk  and  @BTC_Archive Elon Musk: Makes #Bitcoin go up 400 billion in market cap with Tesla accepting it.  Elon Musk: Makes #Bitcoin go down 100 billion in market cap with Tesla no longer accepting it.   Bitcoin Maxi’s: “So reckless. Can’t believe  @elonmusk  screwed $BTC like that.” There are only two crypto armies on twitter strong enough to trend big in only minutes.   #Dogecoin and #Bitcoin   That says a lot!  $BTC & $DOGE to the mooooooooooon!  #PayMeInDogecoin #PayMeInBitcoin Some call it a #Bitcoin and #Dogecoin crash... other’s call it a huge discount on the future cryptocurrencies of earth!

Fear not, Satoshi Nakamoto and I are working very hard on integrating #Dogecoin and #Bitcoin  Good guy. He does need some sun though after being underground for so long  Any #Bitcoin maxi’s hating on Elon Musk must not realize that by doing so they are tempting  @ElonMusk  to get #Tesla to sell all their $BTC and put it in $DOGE instead  Just posted an exclusive interview on Final Stand with  @maxotg_  the guy who went up on stage at the #Bitcoin conference and yelled #Dogecoin TO THE MOOOOOOON!!! Wether you like the consequences of it or not Elon Musk knows what he is doing. His plan is to make #Dogecoin pass #Bitcoin one day and many of his current moves are made with that end goal in mind. I have never heard anyone give a good argument of why #Dogecoin does not have what it takes to pass #Bitcoin New inflation report out!  YA… IT SUCKS AGAIN.  If you don’t own any #Dogecoin or #Bitcoin what the heck are you doing? I am still holding my #Dogecoin and #Bitcoin despite the recent drops. Not the first time this has happened. Won’t be the last. We all know what often comes next  This has been a FANTASTIC week for #Bitcoin but #Dogecoin & #Etherium have each gone up by more than Bitcoin & any other top crypto this week by far!   $BTC - Store of value  $Doge - Currency + $ETH - Currency +  The best value in the current market is with Dogecoin & Ethereum  One thing that is consistently true with #Dogecoin & #Bitcoin is that almost every #CryptoCrash is followed by a huge spike in the coming months.

 LinaSeiche,"Surveillance is the result of governments not trusting their people.  #Bitcoin is the result of people not trusting their governments. The first step isn’t understanding #Bitcoin, it’s understanding fiat.  Once you understand how fiat works, you’ll understand why #Bitcoin matters. #Bitcoin isn’t just money, it’s the best form of money we‘ve ever had. Fiat: You earn it. Your bank owns it. Your government takes it.  #Bitcoin: You earn it. You own it. Nobody can take it. Your leaders break the rules they ask you to follow.  They print the money they ask you to work for.  Opt out of the currency they ask you to use.  #Bitcoin Less than 4x away from $100,000. #Bitcoin You’re not late to #Bitcoin.  You’re earlier than most institutions.  You’re earlier than most of your friends and family.  You’re earlier than most of the population.  If you’re entering Bitcoin now, you’re still earlier than most. Since the ECB called Bitcoin “the evil spawn of the financial crisis,” it has added €2 trillion to its balance sheet, and the euro has lost 64% in value against #Bitcoin. Multi-billion dollar companies are FOMOing into #Bitcoin.  Sit back and enjoy the ride. If #Bitcoin can reach $1 trillion, it can reach $10 trillion. The world’s richest person is getting into #Bitcoin.  The world’s largest asset manager is getting into #Bitcoin.  Ignore at your own risk. 2017: “#Bitcoin dropped to $3,000. It’s a bubble.”  2021: “#Bitcoin dropped to $30,000. It’s a bubble.  Soon: “#Bitcoin dropped to $300,000. It’s a bubble.” #Bitcoin hash rate and mining difficulty are at all-time highs. Looking very healthy.  The hardest part when learning about #Bitcoin is to first unlearn the fiat economics you’ve been taught to believe in.  Once you do, Bitcoin becomes the obvious choice. #Bitcoin isn't going mainstream. Mainstream is going #Bitcoin. Can’t wait for the headline when #Bitcoin crashes to $500,000. #Bitcoin will go mainstream so quickly it’s going to surprise even the most bullish of us. First you buy #Bitcoin because you want to make money.  Then you buy #Bitcoin because you want to save money.  Eventually you buy #Bitcoin because you don’t want to lose money. Bitcoiner for a month: Sells #Bitcoin to buy dinner  Bitcoiner for a year: Sells #Bitcoin to buy a car  Bitcoiner for two years: Sells #Bitcoin to buy a house  Bitcoiner for five years: Sells house to buy more #Bitcoin It’s all because of #Bitcoin #Bitcoin will become a global reserve currency. In a few years, nobody will talk about #Bitcoin anymore Replying to  @BTC_Archive  and  @elonmusk #Bitcoin went from an idea to legal tender in a nation state in less than 13 years. The Bitcoin standard is coming, and it’s coming way faster than anyone could've imagined. Central and South America embracing #Bitcoin is massively underestimated, and Bitcoin is massively undervalued. El Salvador may become the first country to make #Bitcoin legal tender. Soon, the world will follow. The Bitcoin standard is inevitable. If in 2021, you still unironically say that #Bitcoin “has no practical uses,” you’re either willfully ignorant or have an agenda. I find relentless money printing and absolute central bank control a lot more terrifying than the short-term volatility of a true free market asset. It’s almost comical for a central banker to call #Bitcoin “suspicious.” There’s nothing suspicious about wanting to protect your savings. What’s suspicious is how hard central banks are trying to keep you from doing so. Can’t wait for the people making fun of El Salvador for the dip to be completely radio silent when #Bitcoin smashes $100k. If you want to understand #Bitcoin, learn about fiat money first. Once you see how fiat works, you’ll understand why Bitcoin matters. If you sell your #bitcoin to a HODLer, that’s forever Once you’re used to making transactions with #Bitcoin, going back to overseas wire transfers feels like traveling back in time.   ⁃ High fees ⁃ Processing times of several days ⁃ Banks demanding you tell them what you’re doing with your money  Bitcoin fixed this.

 jimmysong,"Imagine how hopeless everything would seem right now without #Bitcoin. 5 Regrets you will always have in #Bitcoin:  * Not learning about it sooner * Not buying more of it when it was cheaper * Selling it * Spending it when another method of payment was an option * Trading it to invest in altcoins If you own #Bitcoin, your best days are ahead of you. Don't tell friends how much #Bitcoin you have. Other than the obvious reason that it protects your privacy, you're protecting the other person. Envy is real and ruins a lot of relationships. Every dollar that the Fed prints is picking winners and losers.  Winners: Government employees, Banks, Big companies, Already rich people  Losers: Private sector employees, Small businesses, middle class, paycheck-to-paycheck workers  Reset the system with #Bitcoin If the government can just print money why do we pay taxes at all?  Because it keeps up the illusion that monetary expansion is not a tax. Instead, such actions become ""monetary policy"" or ""adding liquidity to the system"" to deceive us.  #Bitcoin is the monetary red pill. $6 Trillion:  * USD M2 money supply in 2004 * GDP of the US in 1990 * Down payment to buy all the real estate in the US * Enough to buy 68.9% of all the gold in the world at spot * 1.6 years of tax revenue for the US  Seriously, why are we paying taxes again?  #Bitcoin fixes this In 2020, #Bitcoin will have expand by less than 2.5%  Fed has already printed $700B for open market operations (4.5%), $500B for overnight repo (3.2%) and will have to print an additional $1T+ (6.5%) for the fiscal stimulus. That's an expansion of 14.2% total and it's just March. The question I hope everyone will soon ask:  If the government can just print money, why do we pay taxes at all?  Going down that rabbit hole will eventually lead them to #Bitcoin The more you understand #Bitcoin and what sound money truly is, the less you care about money and the more you care about your time. Still think ""store of value"" is not ""using"" #Bitcoin? Look at  @MicroStrategy : they're using #BTC as a reserve asset, not to pay for coffee.  Every CFO will be studying what they did in 24 months. Every business school will be studying this in 5 years.  Make savings popular again If you can inflate the money supply, you increase the costs of everything else. Higher costs mean you're devaluing labor. If you can devalue someone's labor at will, you've essentially enslaved them.  This 4th of July, rebel against monetary slavery with #Bitcoin I just published Bitcoin: A Declaration of Monetary Independence PayPal is going allow people to buy #Bitcoin.  Paypal is the company that froze the Wikileaks account and put #Bitcoin on the map back in 2010.   It only took a decade for this to come full circle. If 2020 has taught us anything, it's that government has way too much power in all aspects. They control the communication mediums, the money supply, the military and the police.  We can start taking some of that power back with #Bitcoin. It takes time and effort to learn #Bitcoin, just like anything worthwhile.  If you're too busy, arrogant or lazy to learn, that's your loss, literally. Money is the one topic you can't afford to be ignorant about.  Start down that rabbit hole and you'll end at #Bitcoin. #Bitcoin is a savings and freedom technology. Fiat is a debt and enslavement technology. It's crazy to me that people are risking their Bitcoin for a little more yield. Is 200% returns per year not enough? Why risk everything for that extra 7%? Most of these services do not make the risks clear and I suspect there will have to be more bankruptcies before ppl learn. 1. Fiat money is all debt 2. Debt brings consumption forward and enslaves us until it's paid back. 3. Everyone is up to their eyeballs in debt at every level: governments, corporations, individuals. 4. We're all slaves until we opt out of fiat money.  #Bitcoin is freedom Just curious what the top 10 altcoins by market cap were 4 years ago. This is their performance vs. #BTC  ETH -39% XRP -73% LTC -78% NEM -88% DASH -93% ETC -93% XMR -75% XLM -65% GLM -93% REP -92%  Altcoin diversification is a waste of time ""Elon, is that all you got?"" - The #Bitcoin community  For those of you that are new, you'll start to understand just how antifragile #Bitcoin is from here on. It's amazing how many people still believe that Ethereum somehow invented smart contracts and that Bitcoin doesn't have them.  Such people should never be taken seriously again. The petrodollar, IMF and World Bank are tools of monetary imperialism.  The world is run largely through monetary means and #Bitcoin smashes this system. I'm confused, what ""legal"" problems does a country passing *legislation* to make #Bitcoin *legal* tender create?  Is there some other jurisdiction that El Salvador has to get permission from first? Altcoins are centralized. That means you don't really own it and that you're subject to the whims of the central authority. If that sounds familiar, it should. This is the problem with traditional fiat money.  #Bitcoin is decentralized and in a very different category. #Bitcoin has already won this round. Whatever happens enemies and friends will become clearer in Congress.  There will be consequences. China completely banning #Bitcoin is the best news I've heard in a while.  #Bitcoin thrives in adversity. (see 2013, 2017) #Bitcoin helped free me from materialism.

Fell as much as 15% to $52k. Now down 7.3% at 56.4k. Several online reports attributed the plunge to speculation US Treasury may crack down on money laundering that’s carried out through digital assets. Just to put things into perspective: #Bitcoin has lost >$500bn in mkt cap in latest correction. #Bitcoin dips to lowest since #Feb amid #China crypto warning. People’s Bank of China reiterated that the digital tokens cannot be used as a form of payment.

 sthenc,"Not buying bitcoin because you can't afford 1 BTC is like not buying gold because you can't afford a huge gold brick.  One dollar buys thousands of sats. Think in sats. Make sats the standard. I'm glad Satoshi invented Bitcoin instead of trying to change the world through politics. The more they print, the less your dollars can buy.  Opt out. #Bitcoin It started with no one willing to trade dollars for bitcoin and might end with no one willing to trade bitcoin for dollars. Lots of votes to defund the state being cast right now. #bitcoin Bitcoin: a sly, roundabout way Buying Bitcoin is the real libertarian vote. When the money supply is limited, wars will be limited. #bitcoin Literally just buy bitcoin and hold it. It really is that simple. The richest man in the world has only one word in his Twitter bio: #bitcoin weapons in the fight for freedom:  - linux  - vpn  - tor  - signal  - bitcoin  learn 'em. use 'em. Go to Bitcoin instead of college. Bitcoin dipping on news that Tesla is stacking sats, Fidelity is filing an ETF, and sovereign wealth funds are asking NYDIG how to buy.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Bitcoin will simply be the money. If you don't have any bitcoin, you won't have any money. Someone I respect messaged me confused about why I'm throwing shade at Coinbase instead of being happy for them and what they've done for Bitcoin. Full transparency, here's my response. Central bankers don’t like Bitcoin because it gives the people they steal from a way to protect themselves. Plot twist: Bitcoin will be the best thing to happen to the environment in our lifetimes Bitcoin is teaching economists about money. Bitcoin $220K by December Nothing makes you frugal quite like believing your money could 8x in value over the next 7 months. #bitcoin I don't invest in crypto, I save in bitcoin. If you think parasitic bureaucrats and authoritarians dislike Bitcoin now, just wait until they understand it. The IMF exists.  Bitcoin fixes this. turn off tv, read books, lift weights, buy bitcoin, meditate, eat steak, get sunlight, ditch sunscreen, avoid sugar, learn to fight, own a gun, encrypt communications, speak truth to power, encourage friends, build a family Mad about regulators botching this infrastructure bill? Channel that energy into...   - buying bitcoin  - controlling your keys  - running a node w/ tor  - opening lightning channels  - encrypting communications  - moving / getting a second passport  Take their power away. Upgrading from dollars to bitcoin is going from proof-of-war to proof-of-work. Hey  @elonmusk  notice how Twitter integrated bitcoin because sats are faster and cheaper and more liquid and more secure than doge?  McDonalds, Starbucks, Pizza Hut all accepting bitcoin via lightning in El Salvador.  BTC at $65,000    Shout out to the believers. Looking forward to quoting this from $650,000 one day.  $100K is such a psychologically important level. When Bitcoin punches through it and the headline is plastered across mainstream finance channels, the FOMO is going to be unreal.  What a time to be alive. ",ENFP,0.0497

Why? Because to help the most people, we need to use The Technology of The Future. If I gave you $100 worth of Bitcoin, would you hold onto it? What's amazing is that there used to be Crypto Scams, where people would fake giving out Bitcoin.  The Future is funny, it basically reinvents the past, and now here I am actually giving away real money for people to buy Bitcoin! I want to send Bitcoin to some people today using CashApp Yup, I’ve officially decided I’m gonna give away money today for people to buy #Bitcoin Thinking of giving away #Bitcoin today I think Bitcoin barreling over $16,000 today is proof that Bitcoin is Reaching ""Monetary Escape Velocity"".  I have my #Bitcoin in a  @Coinbase  account because they are good partners who can safely store cryptos. I believe Bitcoin, with the PayPal announcement today, has reached Escape Velocity! You can't put this genie back in the bottle!  When you saw Elon Musk get into #bitcoin you could hear the final nails in the coffin of the bears. Long Bitcoin Short the Bankers Sent $500 #bitcoin From someone who just got #bitcoin from me: “I got it!! Thank you so much. I am posting a 'Thank You' in the thread right now. I am crying and shaking.” Remember, I will NEVER ask you to send me money or #bitcoin so you can get them IN RETURN.  If someone asks you to do that, thats not me, that's a SCAM!  I send money out with ""no strings attached"", except of course pay the damn taxes if I give you ""free"" money.   I sent #bitcoin straight to someone else's account on CashApp and it felt magical I will be giving out Bitcoin on CashApp for people to have dinner.  No this is not a joke.  They legit made it able to do that today. #bitcoin Would you rather receive $100 in Cash or $100 in Bitcoin? Pulte has   and if it ever gets to $4-$10K again, I will be buying in Truck Loads. #Bitcoin You're wrong.  Please research before you blast to 2.8 million people.  You can own a small piece of Bitcoin, its called a Satoshi.  Would you rather have a Satoshi or some Currency where the government can print as much money as they want? Bitcoin will solve more poverty than most non-profits. The people who doubt #Bitcoin  do so at their own peril. I will be buying some people dinner tonight by sending them #Bitcoin  #Bitcoin is going to be incredibly valuable I searched High and Low for someone random who definitely had my notifications ON! I found this random woman and sent her $1K #Bitcoin. More SOON!  Proof Below #TwitterPhilanthropy I will be picking the person for the $1,000 #bitcoin soon! GL!  #Bitcoin at $44K.  Might have to celebrate by sending out some #Bitcoin today! I see a lot of rich people *trying* to tear down Bitcoin.  Perhaps they would feel differently if they were poor and saw the government inflating away their little monies. Remember when I gave away 1 bitcoin and it was worth $11k, now its worth $60G Bitcoin!

Quick reactions   - the mining ban appears just as comprehensive as believed - even hydro powered provinces aren’t being spared  - hashrate transition is real and the nature of bitcoin hashrate will entirely change in next 6-12 mo obvious but I'll say it again: no bitcoiner is morally accountable for the behavior of any other bitcoin user, be they a dictator or a nun. bitcoin is an amoral network, the entire point is that transactional validity is independent of one's political status (unlike the USD) WaPo asked me about predicting bitcoin with astrology but not interviewing a sitting president as his parliament passed a bitcoin legal tender law   MSM  you only get to watch sovereigns adopt bitcoin from scratch once Virtually everything she says about Bitcoin is a flagrant lie or misrepresentation.

 ErikVoorhees,"This innocuous mistake is indicative of a financial industry that really still hasn't grasped the novelty of what Bitcoin is. How many years does Bitcoin need to be the best performing asset in the world before prudence suggests a 1% portfolio allocation? 10 of the last 12 years Bitcoin has beat every other thing. Before #Bitcoin, people like this were in charge of money  #Bitcoin gets an emoji on Twitter, maximalists instantly use it to shit on other coins. A demonstration of where their energies are directed. Meanwhile, others are building amazing things in crypto Reminder: the dollar is *already* digital. Do you think the number in your bank account is a tally of paper in the vault? When you pay someone with your credit card, do you imagine a shipment of bills is initiated behind the scenes?  USD and BTC are both digital. One is scarce. Here’s to 2020 and the next ten years  May this next decade be the twilight of fiat currency, and may we not forget the importance of what we’re all doing here.

Possible Future: Bitcoin becomes de facto reserve currency, replacing fiat. AND also, large financial firms issue their own stable tokens, partly or fully backed by Bitcoin.   The modern version of 19th century gold + bank notes? In the coming months, gold, bitcoin, and ethereum will all rise, as they are constituent, complimentary pieces of the future financial system. None of the three possess the precise attributes of either of the other two. All are born of the market, and antithetical to fiat. This seems like a big deal....

Has there ever been another commodity that has achieved this? Maximalists see only Bitcoin and Shitcoin. In reality, there are 4 categories:  1. Bitcoin 2. Ethereum  3. Other Valuable Coins, and  4.

Breaking: Apple Pay announces support for Bitcoin and crypto payments through BitPay  BREAKING: Alibaba has bought $20B worth of #Bitcoin  Selling $ETH at $2,600 before it goes to $50,000 is like selling $BTC at $2,600 before it went to $50,000 BREAKING: You can now buy #Bitcoin through Apple Pay and  @GooglePay  on Gemini  Vitalik just pulled off a 350 IQ play  Kills meme coin hype which makes money return to $BTC and $ETH, sells his $SHIB for $ETH which takes away available supply and unclogs the network  Genius Apple is finally getting into #Bitcoin and cryptocurrency  Holy shit it's happening Elon Musk saying $DOGE can beat $BTC is the bottom signal before $100,000 The $BTC pump from 30k back to 65k will be quicker than anyone expects The $BTC pump from 33k back to 65k will be quicker than anyone expects This is why I buy the dip $BTC The Petrodollar is literally boiling the ocean  But  @elonmusk  tell us more about how #Bitcoin is bad for the environment The pump from Amazon accepting #Bitcoin will be bigger than the pump from Tesla accepting Bitcoin  Few.

Guys I think Bitcoin might be trying to tell us something Buying $ETH at $3,200 in 2021 is like buying $BTC at 3,200 in 2017  Few. Buying $ETH at $3,700 in 2021 is like buying $BTC at 3,700 in 2017  Few. Sell your $SHIB and move back into $BTC before its too late $87,000 $BTC this month? ",INFP,0.0625

 saifedean,"Is your central bank behind the times?  If your monetary system routinely needs expensive, inefficient & outdated Quantitative Easing to continue functioning, then it is time for an upgrade.   Try Bitcoin's All-New Proprietary and Unique Quantitative Hardening  Technology. Fiat economists spent 10 years telling the world bitcoin is a stupid scam as Bitcoin rose by 2 billion percent.  Imagine how many lives could have been transformed if universities had actual economists studying & explaining it instead of dumb prostitutes advertising govt money. Getting rich by holding bitcoin is not an unfair reward for doing nothing. It's the market's just reward for divesting your wealth out of central banking & all the death, destruction & decivilization it brings the world. The problem fiat economists have with bitcoin & why they'll be the last to get it, is that they can't conceive of free market money working without them in charge. They think their opinion & policy recommendations determine bitcoin's success, not the choice of individuals. Visa really get it. Bitcoin is not their competition, but an enormous opportunity for them to upgrade from political currencies. Tens of thousands of econ PhDs worldwide have spent years haughtily dismissing bitcoin as a worthless bubble.  Try to imagine their horror when it finally dawns on them that bitcoin is the best money ever invented and the actual bubble was the fiat that pays their salaries. If you bought $10 of bitcoin a week for the past 7 years, you would have turned $3,660 into $218,940 today.  Imagine how many people's lives could be improved if they had done this.   Now imagine how many were put off doing this because they listened to clueless bitcoin skeptics. With each bull market, bitcoin gets ~10x bigger while shitcoin scam narratives get ~10x smaller.   2013: a better bitcoin 2017: contracts on blockchain 2021: screenshots on blockchain  Have fun staying irrelevant! Bitcoin is a life raft, & it's already saved millions worldwide from inflation & poverty.  If your only contribution to a working life raft is to disparage it based on some theories you learned in university, you are a despicable shit.  Make something better or fuck off forever. Bitcoin's pollution is best compared to the disasters caused by central bank economic distortion:  ""It would take between 500 and 1,000 years of mining just for bitcoin to match the carbon cost of the 2008 recession alone. "" -  @profstonge The biggest problem fiat brains have with bitcoin is that they think it needs to win an intellectual argument against their stupid fiat theories to succeed.  It doesn't.  It just needs to keep going up in value & all your fiat theories are irrelevant noise powerless to stop it. The bitcoin stock to flow model makes it to Forbes While Ray Dalio continues to dither over bitcoin, Bridgewater's CFO leaves to join Bitcoin financial services provider NYDIG Replying to  @elonmusk  and  @BTC_Archive Carbonhysterics coming after Bitcoin will be the end of carbonhysteria. Nobody does their homework as thoroughly as bitcoiners, while climate hysterics are either scammy careerist grifters or unthinking simpletons who believe marketing press releases. Bitcoin is the universal unit for measuring opportunity cost.  All value anywhere anytime can be converted into a fraction of the same 21 million bitcoin.   All economic value can now be compared against this one constant unit that never changes. Paul Tudor Jones in 2020: 1% in bitcoin Paul Tudor Jones in 2021: 5% in bitcoin  #NumberGoUp An Open Letter To The Nigerian Government: Pursue A Bitcoin Standard  By  @RussellOkung Tunisia's Minister of economy says he's going to decriminalize bitcoin. Bitcoin has a lot of amazing features, but one of my favorites is that it completely obsoletes the IMF.  There was no IMF under the gold standard & there won't be one under a bitcoin standard because their model depends entirely on fiat financing Now things get really interesting.  IMF sees legal, economic issues with El Salvador bitcoin move To be a bitcoin hater, you have to believe that absolutely nobody on the planet could or should benefit from upgrading their local inflationary currency to a hard currency.   It takes an astonishing amount of fiat privilege, callousness, ignorance, & stupidity to believe this. Bitcoin is an open international conspiracy to make you free and rich and the only thing you can do about it is join early or join late. Replying to  @chrissaccoccia1 Just had a wonderful long conversation with  @jordanbpeterson  on bitcoin, fiat, time preference, Austrian economics, online education, and much more. It will be out in early November. People seem upset bitcoin uses as much electricity as Finland, and I can understand.  Bitcoin gives everyone in the world the ability to save for the future protected from inflation & censorship.  What does Finland do?  Explain yourselves  @OmniFinn  @thlbr  @RosaRyyti  @joonasilm ! Unless you have a lifelong record of denouncing legal tender laws worldwide, your criticisms of El Salvador bitcoin law are transparently a defense of inflationary shitcoin scams you profit from, private or governmental.

Yesterday they sold 2700 BTC in an hour.   Tag  @f2pool_official  in every post. Don't let them hide. Secret is out. Dave, come on the show and I can explain #bitcoin to you like a regular guy.   Like & Retweet if you want to see  @stoolpresidente  on the show. EMERGENCY: If you bank with  @SunTrust  or  @BBT  they will BAN your account for ANY  @coinbase  transactions.  Not only that, they will report you as a criminal involved in FRAUD & you won't be able to open a new bank account anywhere  CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNTS IMMEDIATELY  #Bitcoin #crypto @michael_saylor almost turned me into $BTC maxi 1.9 Trillion stimulus approved. Horrible for $USD great for $BTC. Make your move... Outside of my kids and my wife, I’ve never been so proud of anything I n my whole life.  First #Crypto or #Bitcoin channel to get to one million subscribers on #YouTube.   We did it #Bitsquad!!! Scammer Alert!  @LouisVuitton  at Lenox Mall in Atlanta is refusing to take a http://Crypto.com card because they say it's fraud.   How in the world is it 2021, #Bitcoin is pumping, and these archaic old folks won't take a  @cryptocom  card because it says crypto? If you don't think #Ethereum will eventually pass #Bitcoin in market cap then I'm not sure we can be friends.  #ETHGang I’m very confident buying this dip will be the last great chance to get #Bitcoin in this bull run.  Fortune favors the bold. People have called me crazy for 4 years now and I never stopped buying. $BTC I can’t wait until@#Bitcoinhas a market call big enough that a tweet from  @elonmusk  can’t tank the market.   He singlehandedly has dumped $BTC to $45k twice in a week.   Oh well… buying opportunity And just like that, everyone is bullish on #Bitcoin again.  Remember those who stayed bullish when it wasn't popular to do so. It’s happening. This is why you NEVER sell your #Bitcoin. This your daily reminder:  DO NOT sell Bitcoin DO NOT sell Ethereum SHORT Tesla DO NOT SELL YOUR #BITCOIN OR #ETHEREUM.  There is a war going on right under our noses and most people don’t see it.  There are foxes in the henhouse. Within 3 months, we will all be rich again.  Except the bitter people who got out of the market. #Bitcoin to $100k+ this year. #Ethereum to $10k+ this year.  #ethgang #Bitcoin Bull Run 2.0 is upon us You guys have made fun of me for weeks because of my sources on #Bitcoin. Mid July I’ve told you for 6 weeks was the jump point.   I said somewhere between the 10th and 20th we would start upwards.  On the 20th we were below $30k  I told you the volume would come out of nowhere. A lot of stuff is coming out and it’s clear a lot of people have been scammed. I’ve been holding this back, but tbh I now think it’s necessary for people to know the truth.   Alex asked me for a 5 BTC loan back in early March. I gave it to him as a friend. Big mistake. This is the week #Bitcoin starts the ascent back to the top Generational wealth is made is IN a bear market.  Once retail sells off, this is where your collect gains for the next bull market.

Sooner rather than later.   Some of us never strayed from that message even when it wasn’t popular.

 iamjosephyoung,"A billion dollars was just liquidated just in bitcoin and ethereum.  $1,000,000,000. Bitcoin is about to overtake Visa's market cap at $487 billion. Bitcoin just had its highest weekly close since January 2018. wow Tesla buying Bitcoin in itself is bullish.  But the number is insane.  Tesla bought almost 10% of its $19 billion cash holding.  Not 1%, 10%. This is the most bullish part. Are you telling me, Michael Saylor talked to 1,400 corporations about Bitcoin, and you didn't expect $BTC to go up? I can't believe I'm saying this.  $DOGE volume just briefly overtook Bitcoin and Ethereum on Binance.  $3.4 billion.  $3,400,000,000. You sold your $BTC to MicroStrategy again didn't you anon The differences between 2017 #Bitcoin rally and 2020.  No Tether FUD Exchanges regulated India FUD no longer effective China FUD no longer effective Better regulation in Asia Conviction from long-time HODLers All-time low $BTC exchange reserves Explosive institutional demand How it started -> How it's going  #Bitcoin South Korea's crypto exchange market volume surpassed the nation's stock exchange market.  This is quite insane. $BTC  h/t  @DooWanNam Hello Bitcoin $50k, we missed you.  Difference?  This time it's at $50k with default funding, no overcrowded futures market, spot market parity with futures, and high Coinbase premium, coupled with large outflows and institutional interest. The big difference between 2017 and 2021 bull market is that everyone isn't heading for the exit.  $BTC $ETH oh no.   oh no Bitcoin If you told me in December 2020 that the market sentiment would be extremely negative with Bitcoin at $38k, I probs wouldn't have believed you. If Bitcoin trading is ""banned"" in China, where is the Chinese ""Bitcoin whale"" selling the Bitcoin? If Tesla actually sold their BTC holdings, it is one big bullish case for Bitcoin in that it passed the Elon Musk liquidity test. El Salvador holding $150m in Bitcoin is huge.  Not because it will cause demand to rise, but because it will set a precedent.  A precedent that a sovereign nation could hold crypto assets.  Huge. A big piece of news went relatively went unnoticed.  Gcash, the biggest mobile wallet in the Philippines, is reportedly considering integrating Bitcoin.  This is huge for adoption. Why? the vast majority of users in the Philippines use Gcash for daily payments.   (1/4) These happened to Bitcoin just *this* week.  - Paraguay lawmakers prepare bill to treat BTC as legal tender. - Steve Wozniak calls Bitcoin a 'mathematical miracle'  - Square, a leading fintech giant, to produce hardware BTC wallets.  Look at the long term. Big.  Khazakstan is allowing people to buy and sell Bitcoin with bank accounts.  This is essentially recognizing Bitcoin as a currency. $1.3 billion Bitcoin outflow from Coinbase.  $1,300,000,000. Bitcoin and crypto about to get a lot of eyes from traditional finance and tech.  An upcoming Bitcoin conference will feature:  - Cathie Wood: Innovative billionaire investor - Elon Musk: Tesla & SpaceX CEO - Jack Dorsey: Twitter co-founder and Square CEO  Big. I have to say, I'm surprised that Bitcoin and crypto market drop on China FUD after so many times of the same FUD again and again.  This is same thing released on Sept 15 (h/t  @bigmagicdao ).  Don't panic. Absolutely huge.  The Korea Teacher's Credit Union, which manages $47 billion, is investing in Bitcoin, as per local reports.  The boom of institutional money into crypto. It's not a Bitcoin bull market without Jamie Dimon saying it's worthless. ",INFP,0.0476

All you have to do is be following me and  @CoinFlipATM , hit like, retweet and tag a friend. You have 48 hours. GO!  Nigerians are willing to pay a 36% premium on #bitcoin to hedge against inflation of their own currency. This is wild. APPLE PAY NOW FACILITATES #BITCOIN PAYMENTS. Quick run down cos my head is exploding   - Elon Musk puts #bitcoin in bio - Bitcoin jumps 3k - Robinhood shorts itself  - $DOGE moons  - The little man destroys Wall Street  - Left and the right unite  - No mention of Covid  2021!  Wall Street just pushed an entire generation into #bitcoin.   This is BULLISH. I'm going to give $50 in #bitcoin to someone random who retweets this tweet and follows me and  @btcmvmnt . You have 24 hours, happy bull run!  A man lost $600,000 of #bitcoin because of a fake Trezor app on the iPhone's App Store!  Venmo is launching cryptocurrency trading!   70 million customers will be able to buy, sell and hold $BTC, $ETH, $LTC and $BCH! I wish I bought #bitcoin instead of a student loan you know? MicroStrategy just bought another $15 million of #bitcoin.   Quite the middle finger to Musk if I may say...  Mark Zuckerberg names his goat bitcoin and bitcoin dumps 7%  Goldman Sachs officially recognises #bitcoin as a new investable asset class!   Yes, they're late but can the price pump now?  If #bitcoin crashed to $1,000 tomorrow, the majority of you wouldn’t buy it. Elon Musk's shitposting may have caused Tesla to lose nearly 100% of its #bitcoin profits...  I literally see no point in selling #bitcoin right now.   It WILL go back up.   When? I don’t know, but I didn’t get into this just to cash out into the dirty fiat system.  Patience is key.  A finance professor at NYU says #bitcoin has ""failed miserably"" as a currency.   That's funny because I'm certain universities have failed miserably at producing mature, competent adults, ready to think critically and take on the world...  The next bitcoin conference should be held in El Salvador. Thank you. Elon Musk says Tesla could accept #bitcoin and the price jumps 4k... We really gotta sort this out guys  The President of El Salvador confirms #bitcoin holders won’t be subject to capital gains tax because it’s a legal currency!  That’s it, time to moveeeee! Jack Dorsey's Square is investing $5M to build a solar-powered #bitcoin mining facility. Rumour has it a certain country will announce it has bought #bitcoin as part of its reserves in the next week…   Which country do you think it is?! JPMorgan analyst predicts 24k #bitcoin... I think this is a bullish signal  Gold is down 9.81% in the last 12 months.  #Bitcoin is up 410% in the same time frame. ",INFP,0.0459
 Wealth_Theory,"If gold was effective as currency, we wouldn’t have invented paper money.  If paper money was an effective store of value, we wouldn’t have invented Bitcoin. A salary of one #bitcoin per year is a decent paying job.  Let that sink in. Buying #Bitcoin is like staking land in the New World before everyone else knew they wanted it.   It’s digital real estate on a monetary network that everyone will eventually use to store a portion of their wealth at the very least. There are 21 million #Bitcoin and there are 5.8 million people on WallStreetBets. I have never been as bullish on anything as I am on #Bitcoin.  This is something so special, so unstoppable, so inevitable that it is affecting my entire financial outlook.   It’s simply a phenomenal financial revolution and I am so blessed that my life led to a front row seat. Real estate is skyrocketing when priced in dollars, but it is crashing when priced in #Bitcoin  Adopting Bitcoin as a savings mechanism is probably many young peoples’ best chance to own a home. People aren’t saving in #Bitcoin so they can buy a Lambo.   They are adopting it because it may be their only hope of owning a house or getting an education without burying themselves in a lifetime of debt. $60k Bitcoin: “I’d love to buy, but waiting for a dip.”  $47k Bitcoin: “I don’t want to buy Bitcoin anymore.”  Everyone wants to buy a dip until they are looking at it. If you’re going to tax my #Bitcoin  gains then I want to be able to write off the inflation rate of all the assets that I want to buy. You aren’t buying #Bitcoin.  You are depositing your money into a decentralized cyber bank that is insulated from central bank dilution.  Powerful. BREAKING: #Bitcoin price entirely unaffected by comments of Charlie Munger.  Irrelevant. Alt-coins are the dot com bubble.  #Bitcoin is the Internet. The fact that billions of working men and women must sacrifice 40+ years of their time, energy, health, and focus to gain access to fiat currencies that central bankers replicate with a key stroke is injustice on the largest scale humanity has ever seen.  It is theft. #Bitcoin I’m an unvaccinated, anti-mask, #Bitcoin supporter and I’ll make no apologies.  I don’t trust big pharma, government, or central banks because when someone shows you who they are, you should believe them the first time.   And they’ve shown us time and time again. I’d personally like to thank the US government for so poetically demonstrating the problems we are trying to fix by attacking #Bitcoin in a $3,500,000,000,000.00 infrastructure bill.  We’ve been trying to describe the problem for quite some time, but could never do it this well. July 12, 2017.   1 #BTC = $2,418.46 The problem with your savings account is not your saving or the lack of yield. The problem is that it’s impossible for you to save money faster than it is printed.  Every saver in the world has this problem.   #Bitcoin fixes this, and it’s the largest addressable market on earth. Money is either going to be digital and decentralized or we will live under global tyranny.  I’m an optimist so I believe in #Bitcoin. What happens when the entire world tries to crash into the 3-5 million #BTC that are trading, and then realizes that the rest of us are just going to collateralize ours instead of selling?  Most Bitcoiners might even be underestimating the violence of that upward move. Bitcoin freed up a ton of time for me to check the price of Bitcoin every 5 minutes for the rest of my life. Why do you think Elon Musk, Tim Cook, and Jack Dorsey all own #Bitcoin? Did you know that the United States’ national debt is 476,840,000 #BTC ?  Four hundred and seventy six million, eight hundred and forty thousand BTC.  Do the math. Money is a claim on our past time, energy and skill. These three make up productivity.  We value productivity in units. We call those units sats, or dollars, or yen, etc. The problem with fiat is we have people adding units without producing anything.  But now we have #Bitcoin. If #Bitcoin is inevitable as I believe it is, there’s no need for us to pursue other wealth building/preservation strategies.  We can convert our energy into non-dilutable units of a digital bank and let it grow.    This frees us to pursue non-monetary goals.   That’s living. ",ENFP,0.0610
 dougboneparth,"I have this sneaking suspicion that person who bought Tesla at $900 is the same person who bought bitcoin at $58,000. “It’s a healthy correction.” -Dustin, who bought bitcoin for the first time at $58,000 If you invested $10,000 in bitcoin 1 second ago, you’d have $1,732,128,726.59 right now. “It was only a matter of time before bitcoin hit $50,000.” -Noah, who bought bitcoin at $49,000 With bitcoin back above $40,000, Millennials can afford both coffee and retirement once again. Customer: Hello, I’d like to buy a Tesla.  Dealer: Sure, that will be 1 btc.  *two hours later*  Customer: I’d like to return my Tesla.  Dealer: Sure, here’s your 0.8 btc back. Just a matter of time before GameStop does a stock split, gets added to the S&P 500 and converts its balance sheet to bitcoin. The world when bitcoin is back over $50,000... Bitcoin was invented so that Millennials could afford $750 cups of coffee in the future. Woke up to bitcoin being down -14%. Meanwhile, stocks are unchanged. It’s clear which is the better investment. I’d continue to comment on Tesla’s bitcoin decision, but I just don’t have the energy. Elon Musk: Bitcoin is good.  Also Elon Musk: Bitcoin is bad. Tom Brady getting into bitcoin makes sense because the last time he fought inflation he won the 2014 AFC Championship. Goldman Sachs: “Bitcoin is not an asset class.”  Also Goldman Sachs: “We are launching a new cryptocurrency trading team.” Elon Musk: I won’t be selling any more bitcoin.  Also Elon Musk: I might be selling more bitcoin. Rumor has it that when bitcoin mining uses ~75% clean energy, Elon Musk will resume pumping it to $100K. When you think about it, the Earth is just one giant bitcoin mining rig. For 3 Bitcoin, you can become a permanent resident of El Salvador.  For 3 Dogecoin, you can become a permanent resident of your parents’ basement. It’s the year 2050, bitcoin trades between $31,000 and $34,000. I can’t wait to try the Bitcoin Futures ETF. I’ve always wanted to be up 2% when bitcoin is up 10%. Tesla went from $300 to $180 before going to $2,000.  Bitcoin went from $20,000 to $4,000 before going to $60,000.  My portfolio went from $50,000 to $10,000 before going to $0.  The trick isn’t just picking the right investments, it’s holding them. I got 99 problems and basically all of them can be solved by bitcoin hitting $100,000. This was a big week!  • Bitcoin ATH • I lost my job • Ethereum ATH • My family is leaving me • Apple CEO owns crypto • Crypto market cap hits $3T Getting paid in bitcoin is very easy. First, get paid in dollars. Then, buy bitcoin. ",INFP,0.0726
 ParikPatelCFA,"Tesla has just invested $1.5bn into #Bitcoin and is planning to start accepting it as payment. This makes sense because Elon is planning to move to Mars where bitcoin will be the official currency. The real reason that Gamestop is up today is because investors are rotating out of risk-assets like Bitcoin into safe-haven brick-and-mortar companies. Yeah sex is good but have you ever bought a fractional bitcoin and tweeted about your gains every ten minutes? Bitcoin is up more than 4.5% today hitting $60,000 whereas the stock market is totally flat. This is why #Bitcoin is the future. The year is 2040:  - The Nasdaq is at $100k - Bitcoin has hit $1 million - NFTs are going public via SPAC - Cars have been replaced by Tesla robotaxis  - Keith Gill is president #Bitcoin is back above $60k whereas the S&P 500 is only at $4.1k. This means that bitcoin is more than 10 times better than stocks. Few understand this.

 JohnEDeaton1,"THE REVOLVING DOOR OF CORRUPTION AT THE  @SEC_News    So Hinman goes to the SEC and gratuitously declares #BTC and #ETH as non-securities.    He collects millions from his law firm while his law firm is heavily connected to #BTC and #ETH.   But it doesn’t stop there. The SEC just filed its response to  @Ripple ’s request for a pre-motion conference on Ripple’s discovery requests for information related to #BTC and #ETH.  My earlier tweets related to Hinman and Clayton prove it’s relevant. What are you hiding SEC? I’ve seen many responses to my recent interview.    Whether #XRP is a better investment or technology and/or utility token than #BTC or #ETH can be debated.   What can’t be debated is that the #XRPCommunity is - by far - the best Crypto Community in the industry.  Bar none.  Huge discovery:  The SEC attorney stated that last week  @Ripple  issued a subpoena to Clayton at his new place of employment for any communications related to Digital Assets including but not limited to #BTC #ETH and #XRP!   Well played. Discovery into #BTC and #ETH is RELEVANT. I’M SURE ITS A COINCIDENCE:  But in Oct. 2020, One River starts investing in #Bitcoin and #Ether.   In Dec. 2020 Clayton directs an attack on #XRP making the ridiculous claim that #XRP is a security per se and then leaves the SEC forever.  In March 2021, One River hires Clayton. One River’s holdings of #Bitcoin and #Ether are about $1 Billion as of early 2021  All the buying was finished in November.  @Ripple  and #XRP sued in December.   One River hires the guy who was viewed as anti-crypto to advise on crypto    Nothing to  Names on Alibaba IPO:   Clayton, Hinman and Leiming Chen  Clayton and Hinman BOTH go to the  @SEC  in 2017  2018: #BTC and #ETH get clarity from Hinman and Clayton. Berger is Dir. of Enforcement   Chen goes to Alipay.  December 2020 #XRP is alleged to be a security.  They leave SEC Clayton’s SEC disapproved every #BTC ETF that applied for one. If Gensler’s SEC gives One River approval, we operate in a completely corrupt system. Meantime in the United States: @SEC_News  gets a 60 day extension to figure out how to distinguish #XRP from #ETH and #BTC You want to see UTILITY using #XRP?  105 #BTC sent over the #XRPL in a few seconds and the transaction fee is .00005 XRP using  @Spend_The_Bits    At Today’s #BTC price that’s almost $4 million dollars for less than a penny.  SEC says BTC isn’t a security but the .00005 XRP is  One River invests $1 billion in #BTC & #ETH and 2 months later on his last day Clayton filed the #SEC action against  @Ripple . Less than 3 months later Clayton is at One River.   Other Clayton related things to consider  #XRPHolders are everywhere - a funny #truestory:  At a gas station near my my law firm a #Bitcoin ATM was installed.  I was looking at it and the cashier said to me:   “Dude, I wouldn’t buy #BTC you should by #XRP because it’s the safest best bet of all cryptocurrencies.” At #Bitcoin Conference and a speaker just said a huge opportunity is in cross border payments and remittances especially peer to peer without an intermediary like a bank.   I’m trying to think of a company and a crypto that has been hyper focused on this area. Regulators also put their own financial interests ahead of the public’s interest.   Like giving a speech where #Ether is given clarity while your law firm is invested in it; or 1River invests $1B in #BTC & #Ether and 2 months later you file a case against #XRP, then join 1River. This testimony should infuriate everyone. He testified 1 week after the Hinman Speech giving #ETH clarity.  Its been over 3 years since this nonsense testimony.  @HesterPeirce  & Roisman just publicly stated #SEC continues to not provide clarity.   #BTC& #ETH got it!   Why = You and the SEC may very well be “technology-neutral” but you are not “asset-neutral” and have favored certain digital assets (#BTC and #Ether) over other digital assets. The  @Ripple  attorneys seem to almost guarantee that the #BTC , #Ether and #XRP documents that the  @SECGov  refuses  to turn over will be absolutely exculpatory and potentially end the case.   It’s almost as if the #Ripple defense team knows something the public doesn’t. 1) How many employees of the  @SECGov  owned #BTC #Ether or #XRP from 2013 to 12-22-20?  2) Did any lawyers working in  @SEC_Enforcement  division own #XRP at any time before or after 12-22-20?  3) Did any of the commissioners own #XRP at anytime before 12-22-20? And why we are on the subject look what’s on the  @SECGov  website filed 1-1-20:  “Bailard has decided to allow investments in three cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP - that are generally accepted to be currencies and are not currently subject to regulation by the SEC.” His refusal to answer the question is bad news. It’s a question that’s easy to answer and the fact that he refuses to do so is frightening. Any asset including #BTC, ETH, XRP or Gold can be schemed and packaged into a security. But the underlying asset itself is NOT the security! All of crypto, especially #ETH holders, should do everything in their power to flip the House next year. If you don’t think Gensler will come after you next then you’re not paying attention. He won’t even declare #Bitcoin a non-security!!! MARCH 19, 2021 COURT HEARING:  THE COURT: “My understanding of XRP is that not only does it have a sort of currency value, but it also has a utility, and that utility distinguishes it, I think, from Bitcoin and Ether.” Look at that: the price of #XRP is reacting not to what’s going on with  @Ripple  but what’s going on related to #Bitcoin and #Ether.

 scoinaldo,"$BTC is the new gold.  $ETH, $DOT, $LINK, $VET and all other solid alts are the new tech stocks. Microstrategy bought another 1.03B USD at $52,765.  Square bought another 170M USD at $51,236.  13.3k $BTC accumulated just left Coinbase  $USDT FUD dead.  How much more good news do you need on a daily basis to finally understand that the market is more bullish than ever before? $BTC hitting new ATHs is cool.  But $ETH and alts going parabolic afterwards will be much cooler. $BTC about to pull a $TSLA  $ETH about to pull an $AAPL  $DOT about to pull an $AMZN  $LINK about to pull a $GOOGL  $XRP about to pull a $GME If this bull run would be 1:1 equal to 2017, then we should peak at a 8 TRILLION mcap, which is 5.6x from here.  This would take  $BTC to $260k $ETH to $10k $DOT to $137 $BNB to $795 $LINK to $160 $ADA to $4.6  Not saying it WILL happen, but everything is possible in crypto. We are in the middle of a digital financial war.  Feels fckng good to be on the winning side.  Thanks $BTC & $ETH  Still sticking to my predictions:  $BTC $150k $ETH $9k $LINK $200 $BNB $500 $VET $1  Only $XTZ to $200 might have been a bit farfetched. You remember how $BTC pumped from 20k to 40k in just 3 weeks once it broke its ATH?  $ETH will pump from 1.4k to 3k in less than 2 weeks once its ATH is broken imo.  In addition, the whole alt market will be the double digit gains every day. Did you really think we’d go straight to $BTC 100k or $ETH 5k without a retrace?  You don’t deserve the top if you can’t handle healthy dips on the way towards it.  Everything goes according to plan. The more $COIN is going to pump today, the more $BTC is subsequently going to pump, followed by an even bigger $ETH pump, resulting in a massively amplified altseason.  Few understand this, but like & RT if you do. $BTC is closer to $100k than to $0.  $ETH is closer to $5000 than to $0.  $BNB is closer to $1000 than to $0.  $ADA is closer to $2 than to $0.  $LINK is closer to $50 than to $0.  $VET is closer to $0.30 than to $0.  In few months these numbers will look pathetic. Cool down phase now, subsequently going to be followed by another parabolic run.  Opportunity is right now.  $BTC $ETH Bears seem exhausted.  Bulls preparing.  Eyes on $BTC and $ETH  $BTC to $50k this week. Q4 2021 is going to be historical for $BTC & $ETH. $BTC is down -14.8% the last 30 days.  $BTC is up 287.1% the last 365 days.  It’s all about perspective.  Chill. All eyes on $SHIB.  In the meantime, legends buying the dips on $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, $DOT, $VET and further solid alts. Yes, $BTC will go to 6 digits.  Yes, $ETH will go to 5 digits.  Yes, we will have another parabolic alt season.  However, don’t forget to take profits.  Better be safe than sorry. So which legend bought $BTC at $8000 today? $BTC - digital gold  $ETH, $SOL, $ADA, $DOT and blue chip alts - the new tech stocks  NFTs - digital ownership $BTC to $100k  $ETH to $10k  Alts to unpredictably high gains  Before the year ends. I first bought $BTC at $3000.  I first bought $ETH at $80.  In both cases I thought I was too late.  Few years later I am retired.  You can do it too, just make up your mind. 1 year performance:  $BTC is up 363.9%  $ETH is up 1107.3%  $DOT is up 1240.8%  $ADA is up 2138.5%  $SOL is up 15839.6%  And that's just the high caps which are on everyone's radar.  But yeah, just keep sleeping on crypto boomers. ",ENFP,0.0450

 balajis,"Act 1: buy food Act 2: buy Bitcoin Bitcoin: the decentral bank. Bitcoin is currently #27 on this ranking of the world's currencies by estimated market cap. Where will it be by the end of this run? http://fiatmarketcap.com They are going to run the “Bitcoin has no value” meme until somewhere around $100k-$1M, when they will flip to the “Bitcoin is too valuable” narrative. Tesla bought Bitcoin. Every company will buy Bitcoin. Every country will buy Bitcoin. India should buy Bitcoin. At $200k per BTC, assuming other fortunes stay constant, Satoshi Nakamoto's estimated holdings of ~1M BTC would make him the world's richest person at $200B. (Elon is currently at $192B). It’s happening. #Bitcoin becomes the flag of technology, and all web services gradually get rebuilt on crypto.  We’re going back to our roots: encryption, privacy, peer-to-peer, the rights of the individual, free expression, and decentralization of power.   The city of Miami just posted the #Bitcoin whitepaper on their website! This is a simple but powerful move that any jurisdiction can make to show they are in favor of technological progress. Who will follow Miami's example?  Estonia wins! Is it the first state in the world to post the Bitcoin whitepaper at a .gov URL?  Everyone should try getting the whitepaper up on the .gov domain of their city or country. A first step towards a technologically progressive jurisdiction. https://e-resident.gov.ee/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bitcoin.pdf… At $700B it’s now clear that Bitcoin was the most important technology of the last decade. The next Google or Facebook wasn’t a company at all. We can. Bitcoin is now more valuable than Facebook. Ethereum is worth $150B.  Over the next decade, decentralized blockchain-based services will provide morally, technically, and financially superior alternatives to American & Chinese tech companies alike.  Rest of World FTW. All you needed to do to build wealth over the 2010s was to hold some in Bitcoin.  All you need to do to lose wealth over the 2020s is to hold it all in dollars. We have laser-eyed mayors, congressmen, senators, billionaires, and actors. Now we have the greatest quarterback of all time.  Bitcoin has only two more levels left: the first laser-eyed central banker, and the first laser-eyed head of state. What happens if inflation actually does go vertical?  Digital stays cheap, but physical becomes a premium product. Zoom > flights, Twitter > theaters.  Even more of life would crowd onto centralized tech platforms.  Crypto thus saves us in two ways: BTC and tech decentralization. Amazing.  If I’m reading this right, all economic agents that are technologically capable of receiving BTC as payment *must* accept it as payment — though instant conversion to USD is made available to anyone who doesn’t want to take price risk.  A mandate for Bitcoin! Make no mistake, this is a backdoor Bitcoin ban.  Compliance is impossible. Their intent is to criminalize full nodes, lightning nodes, and most Bitcoin wallets.  And they are not really in favor of proof-of-work; the very next bill will include some ESG thing to attack that too. IMF pretends to make countries independent.  BTC actually makes countries independent. Zuck & Jack are the Gates & Jobs of this era. Truly great founders who built and ran organizations through multiple decades and tech transitions.  Now they're pivoting to web3 and Bitcoin respectively, while founderless web2 companies of similar vintage are not gonna make it. The federal government is losing control over both domestic & international affairs.  - Inflation - Afghanistan - China on Taiwan - France on AUKUS - El Salvador on Bitcoin - 17 states on education - TX on abortion, vaccines - Germany on NordStream2 - FL on financial surveillance The future of hard power is CCP, and the future of hard money is BTC.   After years of bickering and infighting, the US government has silently lost control of events. The world order is now just sliding on ice and could move very fast with the right hit. The US government has already named its replacements. By sending manufacturing overseas, the future of hard power is CCP. And by printing trillions of dollars, the future of hard money is BTC. It is enlightened self-interest to maximize the number of people holding even a little Bitcoin before the dollar fails. Otherwise those with no BTC will greatly outnumber those with some, and pressure for seizures will come.  Mass adoption is thus a 51% defense. ",INTP,0.0381

Athletes, celebrities, you, me, etc.  We all coalesce into HODLers, united by what #Bitcoin represents, and the change it reflects One small step for #Bitcoin, one giant leap for mankind.  The mission to re-instill freedom, financial inclusion, and secure financial freedom for all is only getting started.  However, #LeyBitcoin is a tremendous milestone, and the last 90 days is a journey I’ll never forget. Replying to  @jack  @deyonte_btc  and 3 others Congratulations,  @nayibbukele .  Congratulations, El Salvador .  Congratulations, #Bitcoin.  One small step for #Bitcoin, One giant leap for mankind.  I will be on  @CNBCTechCheck  tomorrow morning at 11:30am ET to discuss it all.  See you there. Today, the world changes for the better.  Today, humanity takes a leap forward in instilling human freedom, financial inclusivity, and so much more.  I’ll leave it at that for now.  See you soon.  #Bitcoin Hm, wonder why.  The most popular car at the most-watched Indy 500 in the last 5 years arrives at  @TheBitcoinConf  tomorrow to donate to #Bitcoin open-source development   Open networks win.  #Bitcoin wins. Yes, the #Bitcoin car placed 8th. However, #Bitcoin won the Indy 500. We won this race before it even started.  The first community-funded car.  Shattered merchandise records.   Most importantly, we raised millions of dollars for #Bitcoin open-source development. Selling #Bitcoin is a feature, not a business.  Shitcoin casinos are building for a world where digital scarcity isn’t valuable and interoperability with the world’s best monetary network is worthless.  Pawn to e4. Let’s play ♟  Thanks for having me, as always,  @PrestonPysh ! Congrats, El Salvador  Congrats,  @nayibbukele Congrats, #Bitcoin  Understanding what you believe is right and relentlessly fighting for it should be admired.  Those that care enough to change the world are those that do.  I will die on this hill. Similarly, here is someone paying for their Starbucks with  @ln_strike .  Was  @chivowallet  on the other side of the transaction? No. Honestly, I don't know who was.  The point is, it doesn't matter.  With the #Bitcoin network, there is one singular, open standard for the world. Today I sent a remittance payment from my US bank account to a close friend born and raised in El Salvador.  The payment was settled instantly. There was no fee.  Using the #Bitcoin network under the hood, we were able to achieve cross-border, instant, free, cash finality. Tomorrow. 9:30am EST.  I’ll be on  @CNN  International with  @jchatterleyCNN .  Talking all things  @Twitter , Strike API, #Bitcoin price action, and more.  Clear eyes, full hearts, empty closets, purple crocs.  Can’t lose.  Let’s go  I’ve accepted an invitation to speak at the  @IMFNews  Fintech Seminar to discuss #Bitcoin, the Lightning Network and the future of cross-border payments.  I’ll be presenting from my empty closet, in a hoodie, wearing crocs, with no college degree.  The world is changing.  #Bitcoin Money no longer needs war, politics, or corporations  For the first time ever, money is code  Owning #Bitcoin is a bet on engineering  A bet on engineering is a bet on human life itself  Happy Taproot, #Bitcoin   A new chapter in an endless book. One line of code at a time. The world’s best asset got even better today.  Shiny rocks, collectibles, and paper did not.  #Bitcoin is the only asset in human history that is software, acting as a beneficiary to engineering.  #Bitcoin is the only asset in human history that will get better, forever.

 goto_nikkei,"◆著名Twitterにハッキング ・ビル・ゲイツやバイデンなど多くの著名Twitterアカウントが15日ハッキング被害に。Uberなど企業アカウントも。米メディアが相次ぎ報道 ・Bitcoin送金を求める詐欺メッセージ投稿 ・Twitterのセキュリティーへの懸念からTwitter株は時間外で4%安 【Q&A】実質金利 株式市場やBitcoin市場で「実質金利」の急上昇に関心が高まっています。18日も上昇し、株価やビットコインに逆風になったとの見方も。とはいえ、「実質金利」と聞くといつもモヤモヤするという方もいらっしゃると思うので、昨年～最近のポイントを簡単にまとめました。 ◆100兆円 Bitcoinの時価総額が100兆円を突破。価格は一時51700ドル（550万円）となり、年明けから約8割の上昇です。他の金融資産と異なり、本源的な価値の算出が難しいですが、目安として株の時価総額と比べると下記の通り。Bitcoinが高過ぎとみるか、まだまだとみるか。様々な意見がありそうです。 ◆Bitcoinシフト ・米大手銀のBNY MellonがBitcoinの資産管理に参入 ・機関投資家は株や国債と同じプラットフォームで資産管理可能に ・WSJによると米大手銀で初 ・他の暗号資産も対象 ・機関投資家の暗号資産運用ニーズが高まっていることを反映→インフラ整備進む  ▽WSJ ◆Teslaの公表文 将来のBitcoin追加投資の可能性もありうる表現です。  ・Bitcoinを15億ドル購入 ・運転資金に必要な額を上回る現金を多様化し、収益を高めるよう投資方針を改定 ・地金や金ETFなども投資対象に ・テスラ製品の購入、Bitcoinでの支払いも近く可能に  ▽資料 https://ir.tesla.com/_flysystem/s3/sec/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231-gen.pdf… ◆TeslaがBitcoin15億㌦購入 ・先ほど公表 ・Tesla製品購入にBitcoinでの支払い可能に ・Bitcoin急上昇 4.3万㌦（約440万円）に  ▽CNBC  https://cnb.cx/36O85RJ  ▽Bitcoinの価格 https://coindesk.com/price/bitcoin ◆英当局が警鐘 「暗号資産に投資するなら、お金をすべて失うことに備えねばならない」 ・英金融行為監督機構(FCA)が個人投資家にリスクを強調 ・Bitcoinの時価総額膨張と乱高下に金融当局も警戒を強める ・11日は一時20%安  ▽FCA https://fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/fca-warns-consumers-risks-investments-advertising-high-returns-based-cryptoassets… ◆Bitcoin 批判 ・取引に必要なマイニング作業に膨大な電力と半導体を消費 ・Bitcoin価格高騰 　→高コストでもマイニング競争過熱 ・使用電力はスウェーデン一国に匹敵 ・「高性能半導体の1割がマイニング向けに」との指摘 ・政策当局者、ESG関係者の問題意識高まる  ▽日経 https://nikkei.com/article/DGXZQODB266CP0W1A220C2000000/… ◆米現金給付はじまる 国民1人1400㌦（所得制限付き）の給付が今週末から始まっています。来週に届く人も多いもようです。給付金は貯蓄よりも消費や株投資に向かいやすいとの指摘が多くあります。土曜にBitcoinが最高値を更新したことと関連付ける声もあります。  ▽USA Today https://usatoday.com/story/money/2021/03/12/stimulus-checks-irs-says-payments-start-hitting-bank-accounts-weekend/4674379001/… ◆Bitcoin 670万円 Bitcoinが670万円程度と史上最高値を塗り替えています。特段の大きな材料は流れていないようですが、休日のうちにスルスルと価格が上昇。Teslaや機関投資家、金融機関の参入が広がる中、年明けから2カ月あまりで2倍以上に急騰しています。 ◆日本時間 今晩上場 4/14の米株式市場の焦点は暗号資産取引所coinbaseの上場です。時価総額は1000億ドル（11兆円）規模との見方が出ています。追い風となるかのようにBitcoinは13日に一時63700ドル台（約700万円）と史上最高値を更新。株価はクリプトへの期待の強さを測るバロメーターとなりそうです 【CPIショック】株急落 朝発表のCPI上昇率が4.2%と市場予想（3.6%）を大幅に上回るサプライズ。早ければ年内にもFRBの資産購入減額が始まるとの見方から長期金利が上昇。株はNASDAQを中心に右肩下がりで売られる展開。ドル高、Bitcoin下落。日経平均は13日も下落してスタートしそうです ◆ NY株 上昇 GAFAなどNASDAQ株中心に堅調。S&P500は再び史上最高値が視野に。Bitcoinは日曜までの急落から一転し、急反発。下にも上にも激しい値動きが続いています。 アメリカでコロナ感染が減ってきたことへの注目も高まっています。のちほどもう少しグラフを充実させてツイートします ◆ Bitcoin急落続く 日曜深夜も売りが強まっています。一時は31100ドル台に。5/19の混乱で一時的に付けた安値を除けば、直近の最安値。土日に大きなニュースがでたわけではありませんが、ロスカットの投げ売りが連鎖しているとみられています。4月の最高値からは半値以下となっています ◆Bitcoinまた急落 中国の劉鶴副首相が「暗号資産のマイニングや取引を取り締まる」と声明を出したことが伝わり、クリプトが幅広く下落。不安定な状況が続いており、土日も要警戒です。米株3指数は終値で横ばい近辺で、株式市場への余波は限定的でした。今週もお疲れさまでした ◆暗号資産  送金報告を義務付け ・米財務省が20日に方針発表 ・1万ドル以上の送金の報告を義務付け ・脱税など違法行為「すでに重大」 ・「時価総額2兆ドルに達し、大きな懸念」と規模拡大が警戒を後押し ・発表直後にBitcoinは5%ほど下落  ▽日経（無料記事） ◆ETH 40%安 2時間ほど前のツイートからクリプトの調整が一段と進んでいます。ETHは一時前日比40%安、BTCは20%超安となっています。関連する株価も下げ幅を拡大。金融市場全体のセンチメント悪化につながらないか要警戒です ◆Bitcoin急落 → 株 連鎖安 中国の規制強化をきっかけとしたクリプトの急落。19日朝のNY市場では動揺が株価に波及しています。Tesla, Squareなど関連性の高い銘柄が売られ、ETF ARKKも下落。上場から1カ月あまりのCoinbase（クリプト取引所）は初値からの下落率が40%に達しました ◆Bitcoin急落 ・1週間で35%下落 ・きょうは中国の規制強化が引き金 ・先週以降、暗号資産投資に前のめりだったイーロン・マスク氏の姿勢に変調   → この1週間で価格調整 ・投げ売りも誘発し、価格不安定に ・Ethereum, Dogecoinも急落  ▽FT https://ft.com/content/c4c29bb3-c8ee-454c-a2dd-eac9f644007f… ◆ Bitcoin決済 再検討 ・イーロン・マスク氏がテスラ車購入のBitcoin決済を再検討 ・2月に決済することを表明した後、5月に停止 ・大量の電力を要する採掘に再生可能エネルギーが活用できるかなど精査 ・Bitcoinの価格はやや上昇も数カ月前と比べると反応は限定的  ▽日経 ◆一目でわかる 利上げ観測が高まっています。下記は市場予想の利上げ見通しを①2020年末時点、②2021年6月時点、③最近――の3つにわけたグラフです。インフレ圧力がなかなか収まらず、利上げ予想が前倒しされてきました。米金利は株・為替・Bitcoinを左右します。情勢がかわれば、またツイートします ◆リスクオフ 一色 南アフリカでコロナの変異ウイルスがみつかったことで金融市場は全面的なリスクオフに。日経平均は747円安となりましたが、夕方には先物がさらに200円以上下落。ドル円は113円台に。株先物やNY原油、Bitcoinも大幅安となっています ",INFJ,0.0739

 PeterLBrandt,"Reasons to believe current correction in Bitcoin could hold 1. Retesting upper boundary of channel is normal 2. Retesting 18 DMA 3. No 3DTSR has been triggered 4. Jan 14 low remains intact Should above items change, then more serious correction could occur $BTC Notice to Millennials, Gen Zers and older Gen Xers  Many U.S. bailouts yet to come  The Fed is mortgaging your future & you remain a silent majority. Where's your outrage?  It's great you own Bitcoin (BULLISH), but guess what? You still will be forced to payoff U.S. debt. LOL Hot from the rumor mill  Herd on the street  The U.S. Federal Reserve has been the bid under BTC since mid-March, with purchases going to thousands of wallets  Once buying program is complete, USD will be Gold- and BTC-backed. Put that in your hard wallet and smoke it. A 37% correction from the recent top would bring $BTC back to $14,235  The interesting thing about the psychology of market speculation is this -- many traders who swore they would be buyers of a big dip when price was above $19,000 will actually become sellers under $15k During the 2015-2017 bull market in Bitcoin $BTC, there were 9 significant corrections with the following averages:  37% decline from high to low 14 weeks from one ATH to the next ATH  Since the early Sep low there have been two 10% corrections Bitcoin is UP $BTC Global stocks are UP $SPY Precious metals are UP $GC_F Raw material prices are UP $ZS_F  The common theme?  The DEMISE and DEVALUATION of the U.S. Dollar Bitcoin -- IF the current gains hold through end of Oct -- is poised for the second highest monthly close ever $BTC Institutions are increasingly involved in Bitcoin ownership Institutions mark the value of their assets monthly It is a major development that a global corporation is now putting $BTC onto its balance sheet. The weekly and daily charts a poised to flash a big buy signal. Bitcoin $BTC 10% correction has been met - might be all we get A 20% correction would be to 46,693 A 30% correction would be to 40,856 A 35% correction (avg of 30%+ corrections in 2015-17 trend) would be 37,938 Jan high at 41,986 would be logical spot to buy Stages of a Bubble as seen by a 45 year trading veteran Stage 1. A neighbor asks me what I know about $BTC Stage 2. A friend ask if $BTC is a good buy Stage 3. A relative asks if he/she should buy $BTC Stage 4. A person I've not seen in 30 yrs, calls, bragging he/she bought $BTC Bitcoin $BTC is redefining the concept of ""overbought."" Bull markets become and remain overbought. Major bull markets become overbought majorly. Historic bull markets become historically overbought. Red arrows mark midpoints of parabolic advances Full disclosure -I am NOT a $BTC maximalist -In 46 yrs trading, I've never seen a more exciting market with a similar narrative 3. My largest current single non-real estate holding is Bitcoin. Yet, for me, BTC is just another market to be traded, like Beans or T-Notes or Sugar Laser eyes.  The single most bearish factor I am presently considering for Bitcoin.   Unbridled enthusiasm + FOMO buying usually =s deep and/or long correction  Not only is it obnoxious, it is stupid  If you want the world to take $BTC seriously, then stop acting like children $BTC was revolutionary technology (transparent, trustworthy, secure and universally accepted store-of-value) Who is to say that $BTC will remain apex predator of fiats forever Might newer tech make $BTC the Yahoo of Google or MySpace of Facebook? I need to express my greatest respect and awe for the Ys and Zs who are embracing investing, trading and cryptos in a remarkable way. I welcome you to the world of trading and am learning a lot from you. I hope $BTC $XRP et al go to the Moon and beyond. Replying to  @ctoLarsson  and  @PARABOLIT Big picture perspective on owning $BTC in appropriate size with money you can afford to lose  Market topped $64,7kf Market corrected to $30,0k Worst I can envision is $21,0k  Why would someone bail out of non-leveraged longs when the market already had 80% of worst case drop? Challenge to $BTC price historians In past 10 years (since May 2011) please identify a single (even one) instance:  1. When a 50%-plus correction did not lead to at least a 70% correction 2. When a 50%+ correction made a new ATH within 7 months The 5-week rectangle continues to form. The daily chart is decidedly negative. The burden of proof is on the bulls unless they can keep $BTC above $29,000. For the record, I completely understand how ppl feel disenfranchised by the Upper 1% ers, the Fed, government, Wall Street, banks, et al. I get it.  And, I completely understand how ppl see $BTC and cryptos as something that can level the playing field.  I am cheering you on  Note to my trolls (assuming you can read)  Let me type this really slow so that you might understand -- I have only shorted cryptos once in my life (Nov 14, 2018)  I have been continually long $BTC since early Apr 2019. I want Bitcoin price to go UP (spelled U P) ",INFP,0.0350
 Travis_Kling,"5 years of trendlines perfecting coinciding with the most highly anticipated event in BTC history. Fireworks in store! Today, #Bitcoin 's block reward was programmatically cut in half, as it is every four years.  Tomorrow, for the first time in the history of the United States, the Federal Reserve will purchase ETFs.  Hard vs soft. Sound vs unsound. The price of #Bitcoin increased 0.60% from the end of February to the end of April amidst one of the most catastrophic economic events in history.  A store of value. You can’t fully understand how antifragile #Bitcoin is until you see it go through a period like this- juxtaposed against such obviously rickety financial markets.  Pay attention. You’ve never seen anything like this before. Never been anything like this before. I don't know how long this will last, but-  After the dust settles. After economic activity resumes. After CBs & govts inject *many trillions* of new dollars by increasing bal sheets & deficits.  Off that bottom, there is no other asset on the planet that will move like #Bitcoin A lot of folks have been asking why BTC isn’t higher right now.  If you own #Bitcoin, just be patient.  BTC has historically transferred wealth from impatient hands to patient. Just be patient.  Central banks are doing all the leg work for you as we speak. Just be patient. I call this chart ""The Traditional Onslaught"".  We've been talking about ""The Herd"" for 3+ years. The Herd requires career risk cover. This is that.  They are by definition not early adopters, but their pockets are deep & their capital is sticky. #Bitcoin is just getting started. For the record, the last time we had a presidential debate, the price of #Bitcoin was $617. Blackrock has $7.8 trillion under management (which is coincidentally about double what the US deficit will be in 2021) and there are still folks out here selling/shorting #Bitcoin because ""muh Tether scam"". If you think #Bitcoin is a ponzi, wait till you figure out how Social Security works. HAVE YOURSELF A MONTH #Bitcoin #Bitcoin is worth a trillion bucks & its never spent a dollar on marketing.  Never had a CEO or a board meeting.  Never had a budget.  Never lobbied.  Never done a partnership.  Never hired a lawyer or an auditor.  Never existed in physical form.  We’ve never had anything like it With a new ATH today and the $COIN IPO tomorrow, you're going to have normies asking you questions about #Bitcoin again. Be patient. Be humble. Be helpful.  Below are some good links to get started- Been seeing some “Bitcoin is anti-American because it destabilizes the dollar as the world reserve currency” lately.  Let’s be very clear. US elected & appointed officials have done that themselves. Totally independent of BTC. And it’s getting worse.  #Bitcoin is the life raft. Another unbelievable month.   Q1 2021 will go down in the history books as one of the most bullish periods ever for #Bitcoin and crypto broadly. This is a thread about The Everything Bubble. And about #Bitcoin being for the people. You need to understand where we are in this market right now-   We got the literal POPE sneak dissing #Bitcoin.  I’ve got Class of 2012 traders telling me this is the most coordinated multifaceted FUD campaign they’ve EVER seen.  F&G Index at 12.  What happens if BTC doesn’t die? An incomplete list of events that stressed #Bitcoin but eventually made it stronger. An antifragility list, if you will. June 2021 brought the most aggressive sovereign assault on #Bitcoin ever. That is not hyperbole, that is fact. Check this timeline- 25 discrete events in 30 days and I'm sure I missed a couple. A massive concerted effort from China. Yet here we are, making blocks & trading $33k. It's stunning that #Bitcoin hashrate just had its largest drop in history and price is up 40% in 10 days.  Antifragile to an awe-inspiring degree. The world's never had anything like this thing and it's an honor to just be involved. Best part about the Boomerberg article on “WH crypto oversight”-  They recuse the Tim Wu guy (only person in entire WH who knows anything on crypto) from helping bc he owns a couple bucks of BTC  Meanwhile half the Fed & a third of Congress just hammering insider trades.

 ki_young_ju,"It's a whale war, and you know who got the real power.  US Institutional Investors - Coinbase Outflow = STRONG BUY - Coinbase Premium = BUY  BTC Whales - BTC Reserve = BUY - Stablecoin Inflow TXs = BUY  Miners - Miner Outflows =  SELL - Miner to Exchange Flows =  SELL Another significant Coinbase outflows at 48k. US institutional investors are still buying $BTC.  I think the major reason for this drop is the jittering macro environment like the 10-year Treasury note, not whale deposits, miner selling, and lack of institutional demand. 13k $BTC flowed out from Coinbase a few hours ago.  It seems those BTC went to multiple Coinbase custody wallets. US institutional investors are still buying Bitcoin at the 48k price.  This is the strongest bullish signal I've ever seen.  Chart  https://cryptoquant.com/overview/full/413?window=hour… 15k Coinbase outflow at 37,413.   It seems like lots of OTC deals are on-going lately.  $BTC Massive Coinbase outflows. 15k $BTC at 32.4k  Looking at the TX, it went to custody wallets that only have in-going transactions. It's likely to be OTC deals from institutional investors.  I believe this is the strongest bullish signal.   Chart  https://cryptoquant.com/overview/full/413?window=hour… Whales are depositing $BTC to exchanges.  No doubt it'll hit $100k this year, but in the short-term, if we wouldn't see any significant buying pressure from @CoinbasePro, I think $BTC would be bearish.  Should keep eyes on Coinbase outflow and Coinbase Premium(will launch by tmr) There are many institutional investors who bought $BTC at the 30-32k level. The Coinbase outflow on Jan 2nd was a three-year high.  Speculative guess, but if these guys are behind this bull-run, they'll protect the 30k level. Even if we have a dip, it wouldn't go down below 28k. It seems like the $BTC correction is done Another insane Coinbase outflow. 35k BTC. Institutions FOMO buying How to buy $BTC at the global bottoms:  1. $BTC drops hard over -30% 2. All Exchange Inflow Mean (MA7) spikes over 2.5 BTC 3. The indicator cools down 4. ALL-IN $BTC 5. Become a billionaire and give a tip to  @cryptoquant_com    Chart  https://cryptoquant.com/overview/full/240?window=day… Coinbase Premium Index was always significantly high when $BTC price breaking 20k, 30k, 40k, and 50k. It was significantly negative when the price breaking 60k.   This 60k bull-run is not US institution-driven, it all came from stablecoins.  Chart  https://cryptoquant.com/prochart/fdxeih58iv… 12k $BTC flowed out from Coinbase again.  Institutions are still accumulating $BTC in this range.  Chart  https://cryptoquant.com/overview/full/413?window=hour… Are we in the market cycle high?  No.  When the market reaches its peak, everyone deposits BTC to exchanges to sell. # of inflow addresses across all exchanges was at its highest in 2018 Jan, while it hit a three-year low a few days ago.   People are holding, not selling $BTC. This $BTC correction is more like a technical correction, and the fundamentals are still strong.  US institutional demand has driven this bull market. There's no change in this trend.  Predicting a short-term move became hard due to derivative markets and altcoin season tho. Imagine when SEC approves Bitcoin ETFs.   US followers like Korea will approve Bitcoin ETFs, more global institutions will buy BTC, and more global financial services will launch Bitcoin funds.   How much BTC price would be then?  The bull market may last longer than we thought. $BTC is ready to get another leg up.  A significant amount of Bitcoins has flowed out across all exchanges, weakening selling pressure.  Chart https://cryptoquant.com/prochart/nfihpalo76… Miners keep holding $BTC.  Bitcoins periodically sent to exchanges from miners are decreasing.  Chinese regulations can force miners to sell their rigs but not Bitcoin.  (Disclaimer: I'm not a Bitcoin maxi) $BTC market is very uncertain right now.   Whale selling indicates a bear/fake-bull market, and retail selling implies a bull market. We're in neutral now.  Stop trade, be patient and wait for the next volatility. Whales are sending $BTC to derivative exchanges from other exchanges to punt new positions or fill up margins.  If you look at the historical data, the price goes up in the long term after their accumulation. Their positions seem to be long positions. $BTC whales are moving to derivative exchanges from other exchanges, possibly to punt long positions.  Each time they moved, the price has been likely to go up in the long term.  Live Chart  https://cryptoquant.com/prochart/vt3bikq54q… This rally has been driven by whale buying, not short squeeze.  Massive $BTC buying market orders in derivative exchanges are not from short liquidations.  This indicates: 1/ There are no big short positions liquidated so far 2/ Whales punted long positions since the dip ",INTP,0.0450
 BillyM2k,"Differentiation factors are important. BTC - digital gold, ETH - digital gold, DOGE - digital gold, that doesn’t really work in a hyper competitive market.  What I think it should be:  BTC - Digital Gold  ETH - Web 3.0 Platform   DOGE - DOG MONEY DOG MONEY All respect to Bitcoin, our grandfather coin, without it, Dogecoin would not exist.   ...But this is funny  I just want to point out yet again, the three cryptos listed are BTC, ETH, and DOGE. Companies pick which coins they use to market very specifically. These are good signals for how strong of a brand Dogecoin is.  Also, cool! Camping World! More stuff to buy with DOGE the better! Bitcoin has dropped about 24% from its ATH, even with all the adoption, powerhouse names supporting it, big money backing it up, infrastructure in place for it, its ""cap,"" and the top brand name recognition.  It happens.  Hopefully it recovers. It's been resilient thus far! Three things I love about this:  #1: The pixel Dogecoin is adorbs   #2: Having Dogecoin alongside BTC and ETH is pretty awesome   #3: Pokemon is awesome too :) An old Bitcoin meme that people might enjoy  My opinion on other top coins:  BTC - OG I like it  ETH - made me money so i like it  BNB - i can get stupid coins like $ASS with it so that’s fun and i like it  ADA - i like proof of stake, and steak  DOT - it has a cute name  What’s more fun than trashing stuff?   Liking stuff. It’s funny cuz I have nothing at all against Bitcoin and have always pushed for respect for what made everything possible, but my word, some of that community seems to be trying real hard to be 80s movies villains against the underdoges, it’s just wild to me. Replying to  @BillyM2k  @BarrySilbert  and  @CoinDesk The oldest and simplest scam in Bitcoin / crypto is:  - Send x to a wallet and get back 2x or 3x.   Always a scam. 100% of the time. Been going on since early days.  Before you do anything that sounds too good to be true, ask yourself if it makes any sense or puts you at risk. this is pretty awesome ~  @mcuban  and  @roblowe  are awesome anyway, and at the 10:30 mark, he starts talking about dogecoin (""doja"" )  ""people started buying things! they didn't use bitcoin, they barely used ethereum to buy things, but they used dogecoin all the time"" If any Bitcoin person talks about how DOGE is definitely gonna crash while acting like Bitcoin has had a perfectly straight line history, you can show them this parody video from back in the day: why is bitcoin going down in value, it has a cap dang it BTC In my opinion, there should be no ""war"" between BTC and DOGE. They can coexist and help each other, and have done so in the past, which is a much smarter way to behave.  The only ""war"" should be one against the jerks, liars, scammers, and toxicity that pollutes the entire space. My stance:  I have no problem with Bitcoin, in fact, I respect the hell out of Bitcoin. It’s the OG, this entire space wouldn’t exist without it.  The only thing I have a problem with, universally, in crypto, is the assholes. we still love you still papa #btc, even if our communities are very different This is Bitcoin, but the crypto market all follows Bitcoin. Historically all crypto does is this hype thing and this crash thing, over and over again.   If you bought any crypto, this is what you signed up for.  I know the ride is new for some folks, but it's not new in history. Rick and Morty. Amazing show. Toxic fan base.  Undertale. Amazing game. Toxic fan base.  Bitcoin… on this day in 2014 - one $DOGE was worth $0.0002624 - one $BTC was worth $624 - $ETH hadn’t been invented yet  $100 bucks in $DOGE would be $88,975 now  good thing i put my money in my 0.75% APR savings account good job bitcoin good job ethereum good job dogecoin   now stay good while i sleep please ",ISFP,0.0837
 CaitlinLong_,"A longtime mentor was once a #bitcoin skeptic. Today he said: ""#Bitcoin is the greatest thing to ever spring from the mind of man & I love that lots of smart people are spending their time & dedicating their talents to building applications that sit on top of the BTC protocol."" The land grab by traditional banks entering #crypto has officially begun. July 22 = the OCC news + Visa's blog post endorsing #bitcoin & stablecoins as valuable payment tech, & now Goldman breaks news that it has a team headed by a former #repo trader.

Two things in the announcement caught my eye& are worth pondering.  * the $1.5bn #bitcoin purchase was 7.7% of  @Tesla 's $19.4bn of cash. Why only 7.7%?  * Tesla plans to accept bitcoin as payment but ""may or may not liquidate upon receipt."" Why? PS -- here's CEO  @owenmahoney 's blog post on why  @Nexon_America  purchased #Bitcoin with its corporate cash. It's a good read.  CONGRATS to one of my fave CEOs,  @owenmahoney  of  @Nexon_America , for this #Bitcoin news! Not surprised, given how thoughtful Owen has been about macro issues for years. We started talking about BTC in ~2015, I think. Welcome to rarified CEO air, Owen! I'M DOING BACKFLIPS over latest draft  @uniformlaws  proposal for US commercial laws (#UCC) for #Bitcoin & #crypto. Not done yet but has HUGELY moved in right direction (#supernegotiability + security interests perfected by #control, not paper filing!) #Wyoming law already there! WHY does the media insist on interviewing idiots about #bitcoin, instead of people who actually know something about it??? No wonder newbies are confused. Stop listening to people who aren’t on the knowledge frontier! Hint: #WallSt analysts & traditional talking heads are not! 1/ IT'S CLEAR a US #crypto regulatory crackdown is starting but I'm optimistic bc most of the major players/agencies have spoken already & the policy is taking shape: it's ""pay taxes, comply w/ laws & don't take shortcuts, & we'll enable the innovation."" It's NOT a ""#bitcoin ban"" “MUSK IMPLIES TESLA MAY SELL OR HAS SOLD BITCOIN HOLDINGS”=Bloomberg headline today  #GoodRiddance? Or, alternatively, might it be this?   “Musk buys more #bitcoin on price dip”=future headline coming soon??? Oh, and:  Knock knock.   Who’s there?  SEC. “#Bitcoin was designed to be protected from the influence of charismatic leaders.” —Satoshi Nakamoto WHAT I FIND MOST SIGNIFICANT about #ElSalvador's move=it has nothing to do with speculating on #bitcoin's price (how refreshing!!).

Wow this is #ElSalvador’s proposed #bitcoin-as-legal-tender law, English translation 1/ THREAD ABT REGULATORY NEWS in #crypto, which I’ve been chronicling on twitter since April.

 novogratz,"The JPM announcement that they will provide banking services to Coinbase and Gemini is a big deal.  Go $BTC.   It is recognition that the future will include crypto currencies, digital assets, and blockchain based systems. Bitcoin getting new friends every day.  It’s happening. More and more hedge funds now see BTC as a valid financial instrument.   This is adoption.  And it’s happening at a steady and now accelerating pace.

Budgets are going one way and it’s the opposite of balanced.   When 10k goes it will move fast.   Get on the train. $BTC will have a larger market cap than $TSLA within 6 months. Both are ‘religions’ though $TSLA has so much risk around  @elonmusk  while $BTC is owned and run by a giant decentralized community who is growing every day. It’s a risk management bet.  Full disclosure I own 2 TSLAs On a risk adjusted basis, $BTC is an easier bet today than it has ever been.   It’s being de-risked daily. I actually think the $DOGE frenzy is gonna end poorly.  Same reason $GME did.  Greed and Gravity.  $DOGE doesn’t have a purpose. Stay with $BTC, $ETH, defi coins.  Plenty of smarter ways to play this crypto rally. @RayDalio  and  @elonmusk  endorse $BTC within 24 hours of each other.  YES this is bullish.   $BTC is a store of value.  All stores of values are belief systems.  And we are getting new converts to the church at an accelerating rate.  Stay long.  Perspective.  Global wealth is approx $400 trillion.  US wealth $140tr.  Crypto wealth is $1.5-2 tr.   so like 35-50bps.     This will grow to 1-2 percent in a year or two.  That’s 3-4 times.   Just musing.  $BTC $ETH $LUNA $GLXY. Galaxy is thrilled to partner with Morgan Stanley, the first US bank to offer Wealth Management clients access to bitcoin funds. I bought more BTC at 56,500.   Just in case anyone was wondering if I’m still bullish. This is a must read for every Bitcoiner.   Janet Yellen, Bitcoin And Crypto Fearmongers Get Pushback From Former CIA Director My take on  @elonmusk  is to take him at his word.  He cares about the environment and he is using his considerable influence to push BTC mining towards a greener future.  Lots of companies in the space have already been working on this.  Stay tuned.  And buy $BTC. It is time to switch to Satoshis.  Too many people telling me at $58,000 $BTC too expensive.  Which exchange will be first to quote in SATS?    @cz_binance  @brian_armstrong  @SBF_Alameda  @tyler I’m starting to think I might just sing ‘Bitcoin please go to moon’ on the big stage at Bitcoin Miami.  Drop the mic and walk off. China news isn’t good. Xi is an authoritarian leader who wants control over things. $BTC is the opposite of authoritarianism.  Chinese citizens will always find a way to move assets outside the system but they are making it harder. Will take some time to play out. Keep the faith. The crypto revolution is moving so fast it’s brutally hard to keep up.   NFTs and gaming, defi, protocol development, stable coins and BTC adoption all accelerating.  I’ve been on ‘holiday’ for almost a week and feel like I’m three months behind.  And I’ve been working . So strange.   For a man who has done a brilliant job running a giant bank, his answers around $BTC are sophomoric and he keeps doubling down on them.   I pray I stay open minded my whole life. ",ENFP,0.0519

 Dennis_Porter_,"If you understand bitcoin and you played the game correctly, these events make you happy.   If you don’t understand bitcoin and you try to leverage long 100x then today is a terrible day for you. You played the game incorrectly.   Learn to play the game so you never lose. My girlfriend told me I can invest her money into bitcoin.  Little does she know I’ve been siphoning her fiat bank money into bitcoin for over a year.  Wait til she finds out that I turned $10k into $50k. Bullish on our relationship. I fully believe #bitcoin is the greatest invention in human history.   For 10,000 years we have been using money and for 10,000 years those in power have been corrupting the money we use.  Debasement has lead to some of the worst events in our history.   Top 3 Worst The cyber hornets overcoming big blockers is what gave @michael_saylor the courage to YOLO into bitcoin.   Many more will YOLO in when they see how the cyber hornets demolish the most popular billionaire in history.  This is a defining moment.  Elon, thank u for your sacrifice. People will hold their 401ks for 40 years with 8% gains and never bat an eyes, but if bitcoin doesn’t triple in value by next month they will sell. Bitcoin’s addressable market is $900 trillion. If btc ONLY eats 25% of that market it will make each bitcoin worth $11,250,000.  Stop trying to trade an asset thats 0.0035% of its future value.  Buying and holding btc is simple but it is the greatest opportunity in human history. There is no “next bitcoin”.  It’s a once-in-a-species event. The only reason you disagree is because you don’t understand bitcoin. Being anti-bitcoin will soon be equivalent to being anti-internet or anti-electricity.   No one will take your seriously. So far CNN, FoxNews, NBC, CBS, and ABC have not reported on Twitter enabling #Bitcoin payments via the Lightning network today.  I hate to say we are painfully early, but we are PAINFULLY EARLY. A single #Bitcoin will be worth $1 BILLION dollars one day. Anyone who disagrees doesn’t understand simple economics. There are now 5 sitting US Senators that are supportive of #Bitcoin.   Hyperbitcoinzation is here. Selling Bitcoin to pay off cheap debt is the worst financial decision you can make in this market. In fact, you should be taking on more cheap debt to buy as much Bitcoin as possible.   If you don’t understand why, you don’t understand finance. The Dave Ramsey approach is dead. One day there won’t be a person on this planet willing to trade even a single Satoshi (~) of their #Bitcoin for fiat. When this happens fiat will be dead and the relative price of BTC will go to infinity. A tidal wave of money is coming to bitcoin. Are you ready for the great reset? BREAKING: Morgan Stanley increases exposure to #Bitcoin BREAKING: A sitting Senator has introduced legislation to defend #Bitcoin  and repeal the “crypto tax reporting” amendment. BREAKING: Tether launches platform to bring stablecoins to Lightning Network. #BITCOIN BREAKING: AMC NOW ACCEPTS #BITCOIN AT OVER 1,000 LOCATIONS. Three years after attempting to ban #Bitcoin mining, NYC has elected a mayor that wants to make it the hub of Bitcoin.   You can’t make this shit up.

 LynAldenContact,"I published a new research piece for #bitcoin explaining why I’m currently bullish from a macro/generalist investor perspective, as part of a portfolio.  Check it out here:  https://lynalden.com/invest-in-bitcoin/… Imagine not owning #gold, #silver, and/or #bitcoin over the next 3-5 years given the amount of money supply increase, along with yield curve control and debt monetization, that is very likely to happen throughout the 2020's.  https://seekingalpha.com/article/4351314-fixing-debt-problem… For folks pointing out how concentrated Bitcoin ownership is, keep in mind that the stock market is nearly as concentrated, despite being >100x bigger.  The top 1% own 52% of stocks, and the top 10% (incl top 1%) own 88%.  The other 90% of people pick at the remaining 12%. My latest article answers various questions, risks, and misconceptions about #Bitcoin.   https://lynalden.com/misconceptions-about-bitcoin/… Bitcoin's total energy usage is determined primarily from market capitalization and difficulty adjustments, not transaction volume.   In other words, the marginal bitcoin transaction/spending choice has virtually no impact on bitcoin's total energy usage. Replying to  @TheStalwart Bitcoin bear twitter went from:   ""it's a bubble and dead technology, pumped up by tether""   to:  ""America will ban it before it displaces the dollar as global reserve currency, and I support this (i.e. the banning of certain property and literal information)""  rather quickly  I have a duo of new bitcoin articles out. The first is about the network effect: https://lynalden.com/bitcoins-network-effect/… Keeping an eye on this divergence. Bitcoin not acting like the duration tech plays so far. On its own drumbeat. Here in 2021, bitcoin consumes a small fraction of one percent of global energy consumption.   Most folks don't understand the nuances, and thus don't calculate or project it properly.   https://newsweek.com/bitcoin-mining-track-consume-worlds-energy-2020-744036… Apparently BSV was hit by a 51% attack?  It only has 0.5% as much hash rate as BTC so it's susceptible to those types of attacks.  When it comes to blockchain security, network effects matter. Remarkable article.   Broke: #Bitcoin isn't ESG because it uses too much energy.   Woke: As a decentralized permissionless payment and custody system using <0.1% of global energy, #Bitcoin is one of the most ESG things around. Utility examples #BTC:   -Merchants using permissionless payments to go around FX exchange blockages to continue business. -Protest groups raising funds despite having their bank accounts shut down. -Devaluation hedge in an inflationary currency regime. One of the most interesting ways to visualize bitcoin's adoption is via a polar coordinates chart, such as  @clockwork_parts  has done.   The logarithmic radius represents bitcoin's price, while the angle represents time. There are many instances where journalists can't own bitcoin or cryptos. The idea is that it affects bias.  However, not owning some of the best-performing assets, like bitcoin, can also affect bias.  Imagine not owning something that goes up 1,000% to a $1 trillion market cap. This is literally something that bitcoin fixes. There is a campaign at the moment called #BitcoinIsForEveryone where people in multiple countries are putting pics out there to represent.  People often think of bitcoin in wealthy markets, but the world is a big place and not everyone has access to a workable currency. In the BMC Q3 Livestream today, the CEO of $MARA said several of the largest utilities in North America have teams researching #bitcoin mining and co-location.

Seriously, why would anyone buy Coinbase shares when they can just buy #Bitcoin? The goal of Bitcoiners is to increase their #Bitcoin holdings.

Just remember— Bitcoin is no more than a highly speculative asset with a fundamental value of ZERO! #BREAKING: For the first time in over two weeks, Bitcoin’s price has surpassed $60,000/BTC. #Bitcoin’s volatility turns out to be its Achilles’ heel. Bitcoin will never serve as a reliable unit of account. Pres. Bukele claims that he adopted #Bitcoin for the benefit of his people. Absurd. Bitcoin will put El Salvadorans at risk, and they know it. In a recent survey, 83% said that they did NOT want to receive remittances via #BTC. #BREAKING: The World Bank rejected El Salvador's request to bail out its nutty #Bitcoin  plan. The World Bank isn't the only one to steer clear of ELSL—the bond market has sold off bc of  @nayibbukele 's nutty #BTC  idea. Thanks to BTC, ELSL could collapse. Dark forces have captured #ElSalvador, where corruption is thick as thieves. For a dollarized economy to adopt #Bitcoin as legal tender, it makes no sense - unless Pres Bukele has an interest in promoting dark forces. See my interview on  @KitcoNewsNOW  here. El Salvador’s lawmakers voted 62-22 to make El Salvador the first country to adopt #Bitcoin as legal tender. President Nayib Bukele and his 62 accomplices have just had their names entered into Hanke’s Encyclopedia of Economic Stupidity. El Salvador has filed a law concerning the $150M trust that “guarantees” BTC-USD convertibility under the #Bitcoin Law. But, the new law doesn’t say where the $150M will come from or how guaranteed convertibility will work.  @nayibbukele  - incompetent, clueless! #Bitcoin is an asset that is extremely volatile, susceptible to fraud, and highly uncertain. What could go wrong? Bitcoin is nothing more than a highly speculative asset with a fundamental value of ZERO. Two weeks into  @nayibbukele 's crackpot #Bitcoin experiment, NOTHING has improved. Hackers plague the system, BTC is down 16% from Sept 6th, and some gov't offices aren't accepting BTC as payment. The ""coolest dictator"" is a catastrophic failure. #BREAKING: On El Salvador's Independence Day, massive anti-#Bitcoin protests have broken out. Under  @nayibbukele 's authoritarian #BTC Law, Salvadorans are forced to accept bitcoin if offered. Clearly, the greenback is still king in El Salvador. One of  @nayibbukele 's favorite arguments in favor of #Bitcoin is that it lowers the cost of remittances. He's lying. According to  @WorldBank , sending remittances via Western Union costs between 0-4%. But exchanging #BTC for cash at a BTC ATM costs at least 5%. How is  @nayibbukele  funding his authoritarian #Bitcoin law? He is siphoning $203 MILLION from #elsavador's health and education budget. Despicable. Fiscal madness. In El Salvador, President Bukele is acting as a madman. He just announced that El Salvador purchased 200 highly speculative #Bitcoin. My thought: it’s easy to speculate with taxpayers’ money. #BREAKING: Now, the police want the computer of  @mxgxw_alpha 's mother.  @nayibbukele 's authoritarian intimidation tactics are on full display. This in the interest of trying to force El Salvadorans to use #Bitcoin. Massive protests are taking place in El Salvador against the abuse of power & dictatorship of  @nayibbukele . Salvadorans are giving Bukele a big thumbs down on his use of taxpayer money to speculative on Bitcoin. Take a look. #ElDomingoMarchamos #EconWatch: Thanks to the “coolest dictator,”  @nayibbukele , El Salvador continues to have a terrible government effectiveness ranking.  El Salvador currently resides in the lowly 38th percentile, with expectations of a drop in 2021 after the nation’s nutty bitcoin experiment. Don’t listen to the #Bitcoin fanatics who like to say that crypto is the currency of the future. #BTC’s exorbitant volatility means that it can never be considered a true currency. BTC will never be anything more than a speculative asset with a fundamental value of ZERO! Dictator  @nayibbukele  has announced plans to build a #Bitcoin city near a volcano in El Salvador. This is an absurd political stunt by a delusional dictator. Why doesn't #Bukele focus on what Salvadorans actually need, like access to healthcare? El Salvador  is 2mos into its #Bitcoin Law &  @nayibbukele  continues to burn through taxpayer money. In an area of ELSL where the majority of people don't have running water, #Bukele's gov't burnt thru  $4,672 of electricity to mine $269 worth of #BTC. ",ENFP,0.0360

This story has a happy ending for diamond hands Replying to  @elonmusk Here comes $40k #Bitcoin This is why I'll always have 1 #Bitcoin minimum. When true mass adoption kicks, it will be very difficult to get to 1 whole $BTC China is slowly trying to destroy Bitcoin while they build up their own digital currency  Just assume all crypto is 100% banned in China because that's where they're headed Retweet if you think #Bitcoin will break $100k this year  The #Bitcoin golden cross is in.

 SecretsOfCrypto,"Did you miss out on some quality #altcoins before the altseason prepump? Well now might be a good time to start averaging into them as people panic sell and old grandpa #bitcoin makes a move. The real altseason is coming, be patient. This'll be my 3rd #bitcoin bubble. I've seen it all. Most of the bagholders I know from pre-2017 are multi-millionaires. Most of the traders I know sold too early and regret they didn't make a life changing amount of wealth. I believe the cycle will repeat itself. #cryptocurrency The next few months might be the point of max opportunity for the rest of ur life. It's the beginning of the #cryptocurrency bull cycle & most #altcoins are near ATLs or significantly retraced from prepump levels. Now's the time to accumulate.. while #bitcoin takes the spotlight My net worth would be a fraction of what it is today if I listened to the mainstream media every time they claimed #Bitcoin was over.  If you want to stay poor, listen to the mainstream media. If you want to get rich, be an independent thinker and ignore the noise. In 2017 we called it the ""Mother of all Pumps"". This was when $BTC was gaining value next to the dollar and at the same time #Altcoins were gaining value against $BTC causing 100-1000x gains across the board.   Mother of all Pumps 2.0 will come this bull run. Influencers refer to altcoins in their USD value because it makes them look better while #Bitcoin outperforms.Look at satoshi value to know whats really going on.Dont worry,its been an even better time to Satoshi Cost Average into altcoins.#Altseason is coming.Prepare accordingly BTC trusts, like Grayscale, know a #Bitcoin ETF greatly reduces their relevance & that's why they're quickly adding altcoin products. Their livelihood depends on them onboarding their existing institutional clients to alts.  Translation: A lot of money will be flowing into $alts The fact that #Bitcoin hit a new all time high while BTC dominance continued to fall is mega bullish for $alts. In the below analysis of the 2 main altseasons of 2017/18, the brighter the yellow the more altcoin tops were occurring. Interestingly 2/3 alts had their ATH in sat value in the 1st altseason. In both altseasons, BTC had done a 10x & ETH was making a parabolic move in sat value. #Ethereum is continuing it's period of rapid growth against #Bitcoin. On the weekly, 3 of the last 4 are big beefy green candles. The trend is higher highs and higher lows. ETH showing strength against BTC has historically been a very bullish sign for #altcoins. It's looking like this is the start of #Ethereum's parabolic move against #Bitcoin, which is the ultimate trigger for full blown #altseason $alts This is the biggest move we've seen in $ETH against $BTC since the last bull market altseason. Historically, moves of this nature have preceded the start of a full blown, ""money is everywhere"" altseason. You guys can stop being so emotional about  @elonmusk  now. It's irrelevant in the long term. When he tweets something positive about Bitcoin our portfolios go up. When he tweets something negative we get cheap coins. It's a win/win for the long term hodler/accumulator. I believe #Bitcoin will hit new all time highs this year. A realistic top for this cycle is around 100k but of course no one knows the future and anything could happen. #Bitcoin (low risk) = 2 to 3x. Quality Altcoins (high risk) = 5 to 30x. My take on #crypto: We've started the final wave of this bull run before the bear starts. Supercycle believers will be bagholders. #Bitcoin wont reach huge numbers this cycle because altcoins will continue to gain market share. Quality altcoins are where the insane gains will be. When will we hit the top? The 1st #Bitcoin cycle took ~400 days from halving to top in 2013. The 2nd cycle took ~33% longer to reach the top in 2017. If this cycle extends again & takes 33% longer, the top will be around April 2022. The real #Altseason is shortly after $BTC tops. As $BTC dominance trends down over the long term, #Bitcoin will have less influence on the overall #crypto market & therefore its 4 year cycle will still be important but less relevant as time goes on. Especially once $ETH flips BTC. We might even c some alts do well in the bear. ",ISTJ,0.0554

Bitcoin is actually going to the moon. Because an estimated 7 million #bitcoin are permanently lost that means 0.19 BTC will put you in the top 1% in the future.

 glassnode,"A #Bitcoin UTXO older than 11 years was just spent on-chain!  It dates from February 9th 2009 – only one month after the creation of Bitcoin. #Bitcoin Unrealized Profit is still at a healthy level, showing no signs that the market has topped.  Currently it's at a levels similar to the beginnings of past bull markets.  https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&m=indicators.UnrealizedProfit&mAvg=0&mScl=lin&pScl=log&zoom=all… Previous #Bitcoin bull markets are characterized by fingerprints of increased miner outflows of $BTC that had been acquired throughout prior years.  Even though we're seeing slightly higher outflows of older BTC, this same pattern has not emerged in the current bull market. #BTC miners just made over $4 million in a single hour – the highest hourly miner revenue in Bitcoin's history so far.  Chart: http://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&c=usd&m=mining.RevenueSum&resolution=1h… #Bitcoin is seeing the largest depletion of liquidity since years.  Not only are funds being withdrawn from exchanges, but coins are continuously moving to strong hands.  In the past 30 days, around 270,000 BTC moved to entities considered HODLers.

On-chain analysis studies coin spending patterns, providing a guide to where we are in market cycles.  A thread on our latest piece with  @BitcoinMagazine #Bitcoin Net Unrealized Profit and Loss is a macro cycle oscillator which tracks the magnitude of profit held in $BTC.  The market is currently testing a NUPL value of 0.5 which is typical for deep bull cycle corrections.  Read More in The Week On-chain https://glassno.de/3fEyepM This #Bitcoin sell-off is historic in magnitude of losses realised by short term holders.  STH-SOPR has only dipped this low on three occasions since 2015: - Feb 2018 start of bear market - Nov 2018 bear capitulation - Mar 2020 COVID sell-off  Live Chart: https://glassno.de/3u3ngPB #Bitcoin is currently trading near the lows of a significant on-chain volume node.  Between prices of $31k and $34.3k, over 1.86M $BTC have transacted on-chain, equivalent to 9.93% of the circulating supply.  This is now convincingly the largest realised volume cluster since $12k Despite a strong rally to $45k, the #Bitcoin market still has not seen a significant increase in old coins (> 1y) being spent.  This is very different to the 2018 bear market where old hands took exit liquidity on most relief rallies.  Live Chart: https://glassno.de/3CrWBBv #Bitcoin price is currently sitting at the top end of a strong on-chain support zone.  Over 1.65M $BTC now have an on-chain cost basis within the $45k to $50k range  The green zone below, at $31k to $40k, is also home to another 2.98M $BTC, indicative of large accumulation demand As appears to be tradition, smaller #Bitcoin HODLers can often be found stacking $BTC after significant corrections.  The minnows  @woonomic  refers to, with < 10 $BTC, have accelerated their accumulation since the sell-off in mid-May.  They now hold a collective 13.9% of supply. Over $4B in #Bitcoin open interest has been cleared during this sell-off.  This is the most significant leverage flush out since the sell-off in mid-May.  Read and watch our analysis leading up this event. Newsletter: https://glassno.de/3yPDzlo Video: https://youtu.be/4je8u1qgEis With #Bitcoin attacking $60k once again, only 0.98% of the circulating supply was last spent at higher prices.  Owners of this 185,816 $BTC HODLed throughout all the volatility, the ups, and the downs of the last 6 months.  99.02% of all $BTC supply is now in profit. As #Bitcoin breaks above $59k, Long-Term Holders have returned to impressive unrealised profits.  The LTH cohort currently holds 70% of the market cap in unrealised gains.  If this metric rallies above 75%, it would start to resemble the 2013 double rally scenario. ",INFJ,0.0619

This huge $2000 move in #Bitcoin is all the more sweet given it was done with Gold, not stocks.  In a tumultuous year, Bitcoin is proving itself a safe haven. Crushing all other asset classes and up over 50%.  You just have to be patient.  Just. Getting. Started. Super bullish.  Bitcoin's Energy Value just hit an all time high.   #Bitcoin's intrinsic value has never been higher.  How can you be bearish? Yesterday, Grayscale bought 8X the daily Bitcoin mined.

Historically every time MVRV z-score reclaimed 3.0, #Bitcoin went on a parabolic price run for the next 1-2 months.  Bitcoin just reclaimed 3.0 I am shocked at how robust the Bitcoin network is.

 BCBacker,"If you want to know what it felt like the moment before the start of the 2017 end of year bull run, where price went from $0.20 to $3.40, here is the XRP/BTC price chart of that exact moment right before it began. Remember, Bitcoin has reached the area for alts to surge.  Many do not believe XRP will do anything.  This will be a critical mistake. Sentiment in today’s price move is perceived as a nothing burger.  Do not be naive. These are the times in the market cycle where it explodes. On this day, 4-years ago, Altseason began.  Crashing the Bitcoin dominance. Hopping out of bed.  Remember, Altcoin Market Cap broke out of all time high, with a double tap on top. Now, double tap back test.  I've mentioned my uneasiness with Bitcoin. That could be the top. It could fall further.  I expect alts to finish their run into Bitcoin's retrace. A mass media blitz for Bitcoin in 2021. They’ve had every style and form of marketing and shilling you could imagine to the masses.  XRP has outperformed Bitcoin by 25% in 2021, with excessive FUD and most onramps cutoff to U.S. Retail Investors. Bitcoin has broken above the 0.618 Fibonacci Retracement level.  Next up... the infamously dangerous 0.702 retrace at approximately $54,170. The 0.702 rejected Bitcoin in the 2017-2018 retrace from $20,000 and sent it into a multi year bear market.  Let's get through it! Bitcoin new all time high, $65,000+.  Perseverance, Bravery, Ambition, Faith, Courage, Strength...  We made it  Highest daily close in history for Bitcoin We are getting positive Bitcoin news bombarded at us right now. Facebook chooses Coinbase. Grayscale will convert to ETF with ticker symbol BTC. The Bitcoin Futures ETF launches today.  At the bottom: China bans Bitcoin (twice), Elon Musk, Tether, Death Cross, etc.  Narratives. Every time the Bitcoin bull run topped, the Altcoin Market went absolutely crazy.  I'm cheering for an epic altseason! Bitcoin just closed the weekly candle the highest in history. What a journey!  After being bullish all these years, and never wavering on being bullish all through May, June, July, Aug., Sept. and Oct., here is how I imagine the ending for Bitcoin, and Altcoin Mania beginning. I believe the top of Bitcoin is the most likely to occur around $72,000-$75,000, leading into a multi-year bear market.  In this thread, I will present my case as to why I believe this. I am an XRP Holder.  I'm sick of the SEC not answering to congress on whether Bitcoin or Ethereum are securities.  But, they sue Ripple, claim XRP is a security and force U.S. exchanges to delist XRP.  Let's have our numbers be heard. The court will listen. Join the list. As discussed in today's videos, at the end of the 2013 & 2017 Bitcoin Bull Runs, we saw this same phenomenon occur as we are seeing in 2021.  If this level is to hold, like in 2013 and 2017, we could see the most epic of bull runs for the altcoin market, as we did in those years. Bitcoin once again has its highest weekly candle close in history, at $65,505.  Closing the weekly candle above the 3.618 Fibonacci Extension for the first time. Absolutely nothing changes with this.  I’ve seen too much happen on these charts, just when they are supposed to happen.  My video last night was for the people.  I remain strong, expecting Bitcoin and Ethereum tops soon, and XRP Takeover. ",ENFP,0.0452

The way $BTC is coiling  the next move is going to be a big one. I’ve bet on upside. It can’t get much tighter than this. Feels like it could happen at any moment now (less than 24 hours) I recently got to speak to a private wealth management group with 20B+ in AUM over dinner  They bought around 500m in $BTC  They aren't crypto native, but felt they had to get in and adopt.

 naval,"Bitcoin. It’s not so much Bitcoin going up as dollar going down. To the generation born after Bitcoin, it’s as old as gold. It’s the best such ruleset ever designed. Its believers are ideological.   Betting against Bitcoin has been, and will continue to be, an expensive proposition. Bitcoin isn’t valuable due to tech or miners or exchanges or institutions.   Bitcoin is valuable in direct proportion to diehard believers that agree to transact directly with each other under its rules.  Someone, somewhere, is always ready to give you their house for Bitcoin. Em resposta a  @nntaleb We’re transitioning through a temporary bug in the Internet’s history before we knew how to build open social protocols.  At first, the Internet transferred data. Then, it transferred scarcity (Bitcoin). Then, computation (Ethereum). Coming up - identity and social graphs. Bitcoin cannot be coerced.  That’s why it’s the most important experiment in the world. Em resposta a  @AriDavidPaul Bitcoin is an exit from the Fed.  DeFi is an exit from Wall Street.  Social media is an exit from mass media.  Homeschooling is an exit from industrial education.  Remote work is an exit from 9-5.  Creator economy is an exit from employment.  Individuals are leaving institutions. Buying Bitcoin is more voting than investing. China may be leaving Bitcoin, but China also left the free Internet. The inflation hedges are shifting from gold, art, and farms, to Bitcoin, NFTs, and tech companies. Every digital object with a credible fan base will be used to store value, not just Bitcoin. Bitcoin is simply a technology that, if adopted, moves society to an economic coordination point that can’t be controlled or diluted by the powers that be. ",INTJ,0.0210

Where we're going will bring $10k+ swings with it.  Start mentally preparing for this now. It feels like things are about to get weird. A US Senator has endorsed #bitcoin as a store of value, Lightning is truly blossoming, and the world has never been more receptive to an alternative to our flailing political and monetary systems. Thank God we have Bitcoin. This is the sound cybernetic hornets make as they protect the #Bitcoin network while simultaneously helping to make Oil & Gas producers more efficient with their waste gas.  https://twitter.com/GAMdotAI/status/1255678750512963586/video/1… If you think we’re toxic now wait until we’re forced to defend Bitcoin against a state level attack. This is nothing but practice. There is too much at stake to play nice with disingenuous types. The mission is simple: separate money and state so humanity can be truly free. #Bitcoin If the government wants to collect revenues on bitcoin transactions it should invest in mining infrastructure that enables it to collect transaction fee revenue. Get your bitcoin off exchanges and into wallets you control. A big domino to fall. Bitcoin will be a pension saver. It is a Godsend for flailing pension funds. No one voted for the IMF. It was thrust upon us and we have been forced to deal with its existence and the essence of that existence ever since without the ability to opt-out of their game. Now that Bitcoin exists, we have an opt-out option. Bitcoin is about to surpass the Great British Pound to become the fifth largest base money in the world. Eventually it will sit on the throne.

I made this little website for you: Bitcoin Cash will be the greenest of all crypto currencies.  ""Instead of fees, plant some trees."" #BitcoinCash Everyone who bets on crypto needs to understand that it competes with the money governments print to function.  Make no mistake, they are trying to figure out how to stop the crypto revolution. They hate Bitcoin and all crypto. Big turbulence ahead. HOLD the ground. Crypto wins. I’m herewith officially joining the effort to make Bitcoin Cash the leading electronic cash solution in the world.  I will help to accelerate the use of BCH with real world and online vendors and to increase the user base.  I know how to do this. Join me. #Bitcoin #BitcoinCash Crypto will survive and change the world forever. But be prepared for government intervention. I’m certain the US govt will attempt to limit the use of crypto.

More and more people agree with me that $BCH has the biggest upside potential and here's why... Bitcoin Cash cares about the environment  @elonmusk . Happy to share our long term carbon strategy with you. Time to go #BitcoinCash instead of #Bitcoin. “Let’s print another $6 trillion.”  – President Joe Biden, today.  The rise of crypto is unstoppable. #Bitcoin #BitcoinCash  RIP #Bitcoin #BitcoinCash #Dogecoin I respect how  @elonmusk  doesn't take shit from #Bitcoin maximalists with their outdated and misleading talking points. Elon's passion for #Dogecoin is cool but #BitcoinCash does everything he's looking for today with a viable green strategy and a quickly expanding vendor network. Banks: We gamble with your money. The govt has access to your account. We support mass money printing devaluing your cash. We’re corrupt, slow, expensive and unlikable.  Bitcoin Cash: You’re the bank. Goes up in value. Fast transactions. Almost no fees. Widely accepted. Freedom. Buy #BitcoinCash and #Bitcoin today just to show the Chinese government the finger. #Crypto is by the people for the people.

Congratulations on $50K, fellow #Bitcoin supporters! Today is a great day.

This mindset is helpful for reducing excessive spending in order to stack more sats. Replying to  @saylor Fortunately, #Bitcoin Derangement Syndrome isn’t hereditary. While most boomers are stuck in the 20th century, younger generations are embracing the future. In the first quarter of 2021, gold’s price declined by 10% while #Bitcoin appreciated by 100%. This disparity will persist as monetary demand flows to the superior store of wealth. Bitcoin’s move from $500 to $50K, as a $900B rise in market cap, only brought the asset from insignificance to moderate relevance. The move from $50K to $5M, as a geopolitically seismic $100T rise in market cap, will be far more consequential than the prior 100x price increase.

 n3ocortex,"There is only enough BTC for 1,000 companies to buy 21,000 $BTC.  #Bitcoin #Bitcoin is in a supply and liquidity crisis.  This is extremely bullish! And highly underrated.  I believe we will see this significantly reflected in Bitcoin's price in the upcoming months.  Let's take a look at the data.  A thread  The amount of illiquid #Bitcoin supply in the network has grown more than the circulating supply since 2017.  Meanwhile, liquid supply continues to see a steep decrease.  Pair this with the demand from MSTR, Square, Tesla, Grayscale et al., and understand how bullish this is. ""2% of accounts control 95% of all #Bitcoin ""  Wrong.

A: #Bitcoin  Today we'll discuss the most toxic subculture in software, the football hooligans of tech.  (1/) Continuing on with the public awareness raising about the tragic costs of bitcoin ... today we'll explore the bitcoin killer app: Extortion.  (1/)  Climate change is not some abstract threat happening elsewhere, it is very real, and is happening everywhere we chose to invest in unsustainable and wasteful technology.  The absurd waste of bitcoin is a simultaneously both an environmental and a moral disaster. (15/) Climate scientists have estimated that #Bitcoin emissions alone could push global warming above 2°C. And this is just one of *hundreds* of other cryptocurrency networks that run on this apocalyptically wasteful set of ideas. (14/) Try to imagine a future where paying for your morning coffee involved smashing an iPhone and burning enough fossil fuels to run your entire household for 60 days. That's the environmental cost of the ""revolutionary"" technology behind #Bitcoin  in a nutshell. (13/) Unlike other economic activities, the bitcoin scheme produces absolutely nothing for all this waste. It is a pure speculative activity of people gambling on the random movements of prices and the only output is simply shuffling numbers around in a computer at insane cost. (10/) The bitcoin network annually wastes 78 TWh (terrawatt hours) annually or the energy consumption of several *million* US households.   WolframAlpha gives some scary comparisons to help you relate to how much energy this is (think nuclear weapons). (9/) Let's have a frank discussion about bitcoin hype. Bitcoin is really an symptom of the problems of our era, of a post-truth world awash in crackpottery and of a breakdown of trust in our institutions.  (1/) When economists describe crypto assets like bitcoin as a ""greater fool"" investment what do they mean?  (1/) Tesla has undone any environmental progress it achieved by investing in bitcoin. Lets talk about how pyramid schemes like #bitcoin have historically exploded and the public damage that happens when they do. (1/)  Taleb's argument is indisputable. When bitcoin failed as a payment system and became an income-free speculative asset then its terminal value is contingent on expectation of infinite greater fools and thus its present value cannot be anything but zero.

 Bitcoinbeach,"The first country #ElSalvador in the world to adopt #Bitcoin as their official currency, embraced #BTC  so that people could pay for their coffee with it.  They did not buy #BTC just to stash it in their central bank.  We hope the ramifications of this are not lost on everyone. If you just randomly showed up in #ElSalvador this week you would definitely think there was a huge #Bitcoin conference going on.  Non-stop flow through the airport of company leaders looking to support this moment and bring jobs to El Salvador Significantly less drug $ flows through the entire country of El Salvador than Washington DC.  It is not on the major drug transit route nor is it a significant local market. Now that they are adopting #Bitcoin the uninformed press is labeling them a Narco-State.  Embarrassing #Bitcoin is a hedge against Senators with shady claims of Cherokee ancestry Yes the reports of protests against #Bitcoin in #ElSalvador were real.  I believe 100 news reports and 10 actual protesters So what you are saying is that an impoverished group of people will save 400 million in bank fees-  El Salvador bitcoin move could cost Western Union $400 million a year- Prediction- #ElSalvador’s forward looking adoption of #Bitcoin will drive down remittance fees WORLDWIDE allowing hundreds of millions of the world’s poorest to have billions of dollars go to pressing needs like food and medicine than the coffers of the financial companies. Surely  @prensagrafica  will publish how much #ElSalvador’s Bitcoin investment has netted the nation.  I mean why would they only make announcements when #BTC is down? Journalism should be about reporting news- not advancing a political agenda. #BTC is not political- it is freedom First they complained nobody would use it because of hi fees and poor wallet design -now they complain that fees are too low and it is too easy to trade between dollars and Bitcoin for free. Next they will say it is unfair because fiat countries will be left behind The new wave of tourists coming to #ElSalvador from around the world no longer need to worry about expensive currency exchange. Even if the want to use cash as they travel instead of #BTC, they can now easily withdraw using their #Bitcoin wallet for much cheaper than bank ATMs Wondering if  @prensagrafica  will give an update on the state of #ElSalvador’s Bitcoin holdings tomorrow- Or is it only newsworthy on down days?

 JaviSiman,"Hubiera sido bueno que los diputados analizaran los beneficios y las consecuencias de la ley Bitcoin antes de aprobarla a la carrera.  Por eso el proceso de formación de leyes exige discusión en las comisiones invitando a escuchar a expertos en cada tema. Bitcoin es otra cortina de humo para tapar la corrupción, y los que aplauden, o no entienden, o son los que la necesitan.  La ley Bitcoin entra en efecto en 40 días.  Como ya no han dicho nada, creo que sería bueno saber si la van a derrogar o si van a dar a conocer los reglamentos para que la banca y las empresas se puedan preparar.  Hay mucha gente que cree que forzar el uso y aceptación del Bitcoin es un error.  Pero tienen miedo de decirlo. Yo no. El uso y la aceptación de Bitcoin debe ser voluntario.  No obligatorio. El que quiera invertir en Bitcoin que lo haga a su propio riesgo.  Para eso no se necesitaba ley.  Es necesario reformarla o derogarla. Respetuosamente sugerimos a los diputados derogar la Ley Bitcoin. La mayoría de gente no quiere bitcoins sino dólares. En menos de 30 días entra en efecto y el gobierno no ha emitido los reglamentos todavía sobre como va a funcionar! Las exportaciones y las remesas que envían los compatriotas son los factores que más han empujado la economía. No es el anuncio del Bitcoin. Que tal si construimos plantas de tratamiento de aguas para los 14 municipios que descargan aguas negras en la Bahia de Jiquilisco? Con $28 Mn alcanzaría en vez de gastarlo en casetas para ATM Bitcoin que nadie quiere. Qué tal si en vez de un fideicomiso de $150 millones para el Bitcoin hacemos un fideicomiso para la pensión de maestros? Hay casi 14,000 maestros en edad de retiro que no pueden jubilarse porque la pensión no les alcanzará. Aclaro que yo no he hablado con China. El bitcoin sigue cayendo. Puede recuperarse o puede seguir cayendo. Esa es la volatilidad que señalamos. Por eso no se debe utilizar fondos públicos para chiviar.  Chiviando con el bitcoin.

 Snowden,"One word: Bitcoin. Bitcoin was ~$5,000. Today I learned the dollar has lost 99.93% of its value since 2013 (relative to Bitcoin). The central property of cash is fungibility—meaning a dollar spent by a plumber is honored equally to one spent by a sex worker: they are indiscriminable. Adversarial chain analysis of Bitcoin's public ledger reduces its fungibility over time. Only privacy guarantees fungibility. 4) Privacy coins are great, but they're too small and too easy to smother via regulatory actions like de-listing from exchanges. Only Bitcoin has immunity-via-dominance to delisting. It adopting privacy-by-design instantly normalizes financial privacy. Ultima Ratio Cryptum. 3) Bitcoin's disastrous privacy is the ""missing stair"" of cryptocurrency. Every expert understands it's a problem, but—as experts—they themselves know how to compensate for the risk in their own personal interactions with Bitcoin, and therefore feel no urgency to actually fix it. ...despite the theoretical risk of harming the value of that ownership, I continue to criticize Bitcoin's (and other cryptocurrencies I hold) failings because the public cost of doing otherwise would be orders of magnitude greater than that individual private gain. Moral compass. With respect, I would be more sympathetic to this defense had you not been using substantially the same language in 2016 (and perhaps earlier) about subjects entirely unrelated to Bitcoin—which at the time was largely ignored at $700.  Exhibit A: Distribution isn't the core public need: people will clearly buy bitcoin at nearly any price. *Disintermediation* is the demand.  Rinse out the middlemen (corporate and state), enabling them to transact with anyone, anywhere, for anything.   Don't insert yourself as another one. Sometimes I think back to this and wonder how many people bought #Bitcoin then.  It's up ~10x since, despite a coordinated global campaign by governments to undermine public understanding of—and support for—cryptocurrency.  China even banned it, but it just made Bitcoin stronger. There is also a strain that thinks I recently discovered Bitcoin, simply because I criticize it at times.  You know that whole NSA story from almost TEN YEARS AGO? I paid for the servers that made that possible... using Bitcoin.  I'm just not a maximalist. ",INFP,0.0481

You don't mess with #Bitcoin and you most certainly don't mess with the Turks. $2.37B of $USDT were deposited on exchanges yesterday.  That torrent of money is second only to Feb, 3 that preceded Tesla's Bitcoin announcement.  The dip is getting bought. #Bitcoin miner outflows hit a 5-year low yesterday.  Miners are not selling much these days. #Bitcoin short term holders capitulated yesterday.  They took losses on par with all the major drawdowns in bitcoin history. If you're a believer in the S2F model, now is a good time to buy #Bitcoin.  The negative deflection from the model is one of the highest it's ever been. Amount of #Bitcoin held by the strongest holders has retraced the whole dump and surged to ATH.  This is very bullish. $38m bitcoin and $10m eth shorts liquidated in 10 minutes.  gg beras #Bitcoin entities net growth reached ATH.

Not everything is about Bitcoin.  Or is it? Bitcoin hits $60k.  I've been reading a lot on crypto (books & papers). Just finished Bitcoin Standard.  If you have recommendations of people to talk to (in-person) on the podcast I host, let me know. I'm not only interested in Bitcoin. I'm interested in exploration of ideas. Bitcoin is fascinating. Bitcoin is serious. Dogecoin is fun. Life needs a bit of both. I'm talking with  @VitalikButerin  in a few days, his 2nd time on the podcast. Let me know if you have questions or specific topics to discuss including Ethereum, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, etc. In my humble opinion, toxicity in the Bitcoin community once may've been a feature, but now is a bug.  It drove a lot of folks I know away from Bitcoin, including  @elonmusk .  That said, I'm still at it, learning by focusing on positive educators in the space.

Feels boring, unproductive and has no economic rationale. Fool’s coin. If you still think that governments can stop or kill #bitcoin, you probably need to keep studying. If you don't get the game yet, let me explain it simply.  The short-term volatility in #bitcoin only serves to systematically exploit and eventually wipe out traders employing too much leverage.  You don't have to play this game. You can buy, hodl, chill, and ignore the noise. If you don't buy #bitcoin today for $61,000, that's OK because you'll be able to buy it for $80,000 in November. If you didn't buy #bitcoin last month for $43,000, that's OK because you can buy it today for $63,000.

 parkeralewis,"Gradually, Then Suddenly (#12): Bitcoin Obsoletes All Other Money  True story, I was informed I was trespassing this AM at the Dallas Fed  (District 11) trying to take a pic for this post. District 12 to District 11, you are being obsoleted. Gradually, Then Suddenly (#14): Bitcoin is Common Sense  21 million bitcoin ever vs. $2,500,000,000,000 dollars created by one central bank in just two months. Money still doesn't grow on trees and there ain't no thing as a free lunch. Gradually, Then Suddenly (#15): Bitcoin is Antifragile  As a currency system, bitcoin benefits from stress, disorder, volatility and randomness. It is the antifragile competitor to the inherently fragile legacy monetary system. Let Robinhood/CashApp suspending ability to trade certain stock serve as another warning of the growing censorship trend. Get your #Bitcoin off exchanges in general; it could never happen to you until it does. My local breakfast spot increased 4-item breakfast tacos from $2.95 to $3.45 (17% inflation), so I’ve substituted to a 3-item breakfast taco which now costs $2.95,  CPI/CPE would show this as a 0% increase but there’s been 17% food inflation. This is how it really works. #Bitcoin When anyone in the future inevitably talks about ownership of #bitcoin not being fair, remember days and weeks like the past few. Every sat is and has been earned; if saving bitcoin were easy, everyone would do it but the hardened bitcoiner is borne of education and volatility. Congress has laid quite the trap for itself. It’s in the #bitcoin vortex now. Bitcoin will be at the center of national discussion on loop, reinforcing its validity and gains in purchasing power while at the same time putting DC’s broken politics on public display. What a mess. Because only ~2-4 senators know anything about what the fuck #bitcoin actually is, there should be bipartisan support for  @SenTedCruz ’s common sense amendment to table this whole effort by Treasury to sneak in a financial oversight law into an infrastructure bill. Total sideshow. Houston was always destined to be the #bitcoin mining capital of the world but it was clear from last week’s meetup that the energy industry is engaged in a serious way, understanding it has a critical role to play. It’s off to the races now. Beef inflation 38% from 18 months ago, same store, same beef. 50 years of broken money coming to a head. #bitcoin is the only form of money preserving purchasing power.

 robustus,"""bitcoin halving"" search volume now exceeds 2016 peak, with 2.5 weeks to go: Gold took 5000 years to get to $100billion in marketcap.  Bitcoin did it in 8. AirBNB and Bitcoin have both returned about 10,000,000% to their earliest investors.  But *anyone* could've bought or mined some BTC, whereas the SEC makes it illegal for more than 90% of Americans to invest in startups. I'm confused. Was bitcoin also a bubble in 2011, spring 2013, winter 2013, late 2016, early 2017, mid 2017, late 2017, late 2020, or just now in early 2021? The whole ""bitcoin needs to be greener"" framing is dumb.   It's the grid that needs to get greener. Treat the root problem. One would think Elon would understand this... I have no opinion on whether Bitcoin is entering a bear phase or not, but here are some things people say in every bear market, that have been proven wrong every time: 0/ China actually banning mining would kill two bad narrative at once:  1) ""China controls bitcoin""  2) ""Bitcoin is mostly mined in China with coal"" This is why ""China bans bitcoin"" is a literal joke in the bitcoin ecosystem.  Check the date: I am reminded of years ago when bitcoiners would joke ""one day there will be headlines saying 'bitcoin crashes under $30,000'"" Gotta admit: volcano powered bitcoin miners in a country where BTC is legal tender was not on my list of likely 2021 bitcoin things.

Some people will never get it, he is one of them - That’s ok Bitcoin encourages long term thinking, personal responsibility, self education and a truly free market.  It exposes the flaws of misaligned incentives, while showcasing the corruption they enable.  It’s not a short term game, it’s a long term revolution of our society as a whole. “We are all going to die”   Is my new favorite #Bitcoin fud The response to the El Salvador news is extremely telling ...   Bitcoiners: “This is beautiful. What an empowering thing for the country of El Salvador. Bitcoin is changing the world.”  Everyone Else: “This is stupid and doesn’t help me at all.”  We are not the same. “#Bitcoin has no utility”   -I can send the hardest money that has ever existed to anyone in the world.  -I can independently validate transactions & audit supply.   -No increase in supply to devalue my wealth.  -Borderless.  Maybe your definition of “utility” is the problem. The whole entire point of Bitcoin is not to have to ask for permission. If you aren’t holding your own keys, you don’t own #Bitcoin   You should fix that. Mark Cuban doesn’t understand Bitcoin. The issue is, he can’t admit that.   Ego is a hell of a drug. Have you ever wondered where #bitcoin seed phrases or “back ups” come from?   Bip39 is an implementation that changed the way our keys are represented visually.

They pose as humanitarian financial institutions but they are parasites. Their actual priority is power and control. Fiat makes war affordable.   Bitcoin makes war too expensive. Bitcoin doesn’t care wether you took the jab.  CBDC will.

Then flipping it around like a child does a lego kit.  Totally ruined his brand in my eyes. So insanely selfish. Dead serious : The market needs to completely dump Doge coin and buy Bitcoin.   AKA rid ourselves of Elons sway on the market.  It's been a non stop pump n dump shit coin casino.  The dude at any time could build/do assist something meaningful in crypto.  Instead he pumps doge. Our sewage system, coal, cars, waste removal...any system you can pretty much name is bad for the environment.  Hippies don't say shit about them, while they use a apple computer made in a sweat shop.  Then they get mad about bitcoin because the TV told them to. Literal npcs.

Masses and masses of retail is coming I know a friend that bought 1 million of bitcoin at the start of the year at 28k. He wears shirts around. Tells everyone he knows.

 DavidHundeyin,"Replying to  @liadiVIII 1. Get familiar with crypto. (Crypto =\= bitcoin). We need to be able to live and do business without access to CBN regulated financial services because they WILL use that power even more.  2. Develop a new network of cross-border rat lines like the famous NADECO routes. I think one of the most obscene things you can do as a Nigerian born into wealth and privilege is to use your education and exposure and erudition to bamboozle less fortunate Nigerians.  Imagine deliberately spreading misinformation about how bitcoin works just to cover your ass. If it was Omojuwa who claimed that a BTC txn took 4 months to confirm, I swear I wouldn't even have dragged him.   I'd even have dragged people for giving money to anything involving him.  It's only people you have expectations of who can disappoint. Which is the entire point. Riding on public ignorance + deploying an army of Twitter skills to attack people is the playbook. Same playbook used when claiming that a BTC txn took 4 months to confirm.  Incidentally, same playbook that established Nigerian politicians use, but hey.  Not my fight anymore. This does not really qualify to be called a comprehensive audit report. It's basically just a series of claims and statements with zero attempt to explain the issues raised such as the fraudulent claim that a BTC transaction initiated in March was initiated in November. Also people need to start spending crypto directly wherever possible, to reduce exposure to Emefiele's mood swings.  Bitcoin isn't practical for everyday transactions, but stablecoins are, and they're also safer than the naira anyway.  Let Meffy eat his Ahmadu Bello So as it stands, if I don't like someone and I want to put them in a difficult financial situation, all I need to do is get their account number and find 50 people to each send N500 or N1,000 to it using ""BTC"" as transaction description, and the bank will freeze that account?

Mining co going public need to sell less BTC While $BTC has taken a 53% hit since it peaked the total #USDC and #USDT in circulation remained close to ATH at $26.7B and $62.3B   This tells us that most of the FIAT that was put into the #crypto world has remained on the sidelines and has not made its way back to Fiat land The end of #MONEY as we know it is happening in front of our eyes The acceleration of #Bitcoin during 2021 is so fast that most won’t notice it  YOU need to jump on this train NOW BEFORE it is too late to buy $BTC or $ETH at a reasonable prices  #UnbankYourself  @CelsiusNetwork Looks like we had double bottom and should recover from here.  Good to see strong support and fast recovery for ETH and BTC.   We should test new ATH in the next few weeks. For those who did not pay attention  @CelsiusNetwork  is: #1 with $1B Yield paid out #1 in Margin loans at 1% #1 BTC Mining in NA #1 with $26B in assets #1 in fee free and spread free SWAPS  Now we are going to take the $400m we just raised and make sure everyone knows who is #1 ",INTJ,0.0360
 AnabelBelloso,"- El presidente: ""Todos los BTC tendrán convertibilidad inmediata a dólares""  - El ministro: Madrugón irresponsable, al igual que la dolarización, con el agregado según el presidente que ""con esteroides"" . Además de reconocer, que no tiene idea de los límites y qué significa. En twitter, contradijo a sus diputados y develó que el riesgo lo asumiremos todos. #Bitcoin Ayer conocimos el costo inicial que todas y todos pagaremos para implementar el Bitcoin, un negocio que solo beneficiará a los que están poniendo cajeros y creando las billeteras electrónicas, dejándoles ganancias millonarias.   Una razón más para decir #NoAlBitcoin  Más de $3 MILLONES en pérdidas, a un día de la entrada en vigencia del bitcoin.  Habiendo tanta necesidad en el país, el presidente decide ponerse a jugar con el dinero de la gente. Se le hace fácil, porque el costo no lo pagará él, sino el pueblo. #NoAlBitcoin  Ayer el Bitcoin se cotizaba a $52,656, desde que el gobierno anunció la compra de 400 cripto activos, perdió su valor y ahora cuesta $51,043.  Los salvadoreños hemos perdido alrededor $662,000 en menos de 24 horas.   #NoAlBitcoin Prioridades del presidente:  Su negocio del Bitcoin  Controlar todo  Deuda y más deuda  Meter preso a opositores  Reelegirse en 2024  Prioridades del pueblo:  Costo de la canasta básica  Empleo  Mejores pensiones  Verdadera seguridad  No le interesa la gente. La maquinaria del gobierno celebrando que sube el Bitcoin, pero la gente anda más pendiente del incremento de:  Cabasta básica Recibo de luz Gas propano El pan y las tortillas más pequeñas Soyapango creando impuestos  ¡Todo está más caro! ¿Y qué hacen? NADA. Ciudad bitcoin para millonarios:  Residencias de lujo  Agua potable  Seguridad  Cobro de impuestos  Ciudades para los salvadoreños:  Agua potable  Seguridad  Recolección de basura  Cobro de impuestos  Privilegios para los de arriba, pagados por los de abajo.

 tatymarroco,"Si el bitcoin es opción: REFORMEN EL ARTÍCULO 7. ¿Por que la convertibilidad de un activo privado debe ser financiada con fondo públicos? ¿Por qué la población, en colectivo, debe pagar por el invento de obligar el uso del Bitcoin? Si es una inversión individual cada persona debe asumir el riesgo, no debe salir de impuestos. Yo admiro cómo a los diputados de Nuevas Ideas no se les descompone la cara con tanto cinismo.  Un diputado acaba de decir en la comisión que discute la Ley del Agua que ellos no serán cómo otros que aprobaron leyes inconsultas como la Dolarización. Él votó por la Ley Bitcoin . Entre ayer por la tarde que el GOES anunció la compra de bitcoin y este momento, el precio ha caído un poco más de 5%. Aproximadamente US$1 millón menos. ¿Por qué importa? Porque los precios en El Salvador se mantienen en dólares, entonces estas caídas son menor poder de compra. En este momento los bitcoin comprados con fondos públicos salvadoreños pueden estar ganando o perdiendo en el tipo de cambio a dólar y el gobierno no tiene ni un solo reglamento o ley que nos diga cómo van a manejar esos cambios y cómo se va a trasladar a cuentas fiscales. ¿Quiénes son los “compradores” del gobierno? ¿Bajo qué procedimiento de contratación pública se autorizó? ¿Cuánto reciben de comisión por la compra?¿cuales son las regulaciones de riesgo financiero de fondos públicos en bitcoin? ¿Qué pasa si se pierde dinero, qué pasa si se gana? Estafa bancaria es la Ley Bitcoin, el Fideicomiso de Bandesal y la Chivo Wallet. No hay certeza de por qué detuvieron a Mario y eso es en sí algo ilegal y gravísimo.  Mario y otras personas han hecho el trabajo que el gobierno debería haber hecho: educar y transparentar información acerca de la implementación de Bitcoin. ¿Va a ser ilegal decir la verdad?

 RyanSAdams,ETH Value Transferred on Ethereum just exceeded BTC Value Transferred on Bitcoin.  This is huge.  This is ETH as trustless collateral fueling DeFi.  This is ETH as economic bandwidth.  This is ETH as money.  ETH is hilariously undervalued.  I'm not saying that. The data is. Another flippening.  Ethereum is now settling more value in ETH than Bitcoin is settling in BTC. Ethereum is now the largest network for trustless money settlement.  They say reserve currency status is the last to fall when an economic power gets outcompeted.  1 flippening left. Things that solve the GameStop problem:   Bitcoin  Dogecoin  Binance  Ethereum  DeFi  Uniswap  If you understand this you're early.  Invest accordingly. BTC went from $1k to $20k.  So will ETH.

Study it and decide it you want to stake or farm, $SHIB or $LEASH. It is always a good sign when $SHIB is getting mainstream attention, in particular in #India. Seeing SHIB mentioned together with $eth, $doge and $btc is a sign that $shib's adoption is getting bigger and bigger and attracts more interest from investors. Is 450,000 holders a milestone?

Once BTC takes out $50k and $ETH $2k, all these #stocks call option robin-hooding retail tik-toking junkies will be swarming into Crypto over the summer. #bitcoin gone through crash 3 times size of 1929 stock market crash, every 18-24 months, since inception, yet 95% people shocked.  That's right, not a SOV ""today"", it's speculative vehicle. History does repeat, greed never changes, fast-money get cleaned out, discipline wins. I think we hit the extreme sentiment low with the last move to $BTC $31k and it’s turning now.  Prior Cycle low retested.   Time to turn the tables. ",INFP,0.0326
