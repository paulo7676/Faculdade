Fidelity invests $14M in BC Group 3. Swedish central bank testing e-krona 4. Shopify joins Libra Association 5. @unstoppabledomains launches browser 6. Bitcoin is still not dead :)  More building each week! The Bitcoin halving is not priced in. ""In a world where central bankers are tripping over themselves to devalue their currency, Bitcoin wins. In a world of fiat currencies, Bitcoin is the victor.""  Bitcoin just hit $10,000.  I still think that Bitcoin will hit $100,000 by end of December 2021.  Fixed supply. Increasing demand. Time will tell.   #Bitcoin 21,000,000 total Bitcoin available.  Thatâs it.  As demand rises, the value of each goes up.  So simple, yet most people try to make it more complex than it really is.  Donât try to outsmart supply and demand economics  Bitcoin has broken the 500 million transaction milestone just over 11 years after launch.  Crazy. Bitcoin doesnât care about your opinion. #Bitcoin   Finally it has arrived  This may be one of the most ambitious projects in all of Bitcoin. @JackMallers  and the Zap team just announced  @ln_strike !   The fastest, cheapest way to send any currency around the world.  I want everyone to learn about Bitcoin.  Because of that, Iâm giving away 3 free subscriptions to the newsletter I write to institutional investors about the industry every morning.  Retweet this tweet and Iâll select 3 people. Knowledge is power! This week in crypto:  1. Bitcoin hashrate hits all-time high 2. Gemini launch insurance product 3. Digital Dollar Foundation launched 4. Grayscale reports record 2019  5. Binance US launches new apps 6. Bitcoin still not dead :)  Onwards! Important message as we enter the next Bitcoin bull market:  - BTC is very volatile - You can lose all of your money - Only invest what is ok to lose - Twitter is not investment advice - Don't buy BTC with credit cards - Keep low time preference - Do your own research In 2012, it took 1/10th of an ounce of gold to buy 1 Bitcoin.  In 2019, it took 6 ounces of gold to buy 1 Bitcoin.  It looks like one is becoming more valuable than the other.  What say you  @PeterSchiff ?!  Dear Central Bankers,  Here is a free idea.  Print more of the currency backed by air and buy Bitcoin, which is backed by math. Important message ~ 5 months before the Bitcoin halving:  - BTC is very volatile - You can lose all of your money - Only invest what is ok to lose - Twitter is not investment advice - Don't buy BTC with credit cards - Keep low time preference - Do your own research The Bitcoin network was launched 11 years ago today.  It has quickly become a dominant force in global finance.  Happy Birthday, Bitcoin  Long Bitcoin, Short the Bankers! While the Federal Reserve is engaging in enormous quantitative easing, Bitcoin just went through the third quantitative hardening event in history.   Proceed accordingly. Yo  @PeterSchiff , Bitcoin has a lower inflation rate than gold now.  Just saying. âThe digitization of the world clearly benefits bitcoinâ   An absolute legend of Wall Street is going to push hundreds of thousands of people who watch  @SquawkCNBC  to go educate themselves on Bitcoin. Still hilarious that oil went to $0 and Bitcoin didnât. We are in an economic crisis and Bitcoin is drastically outperforming every asset.  It is literally serving as the strongest safe haven.  The people are waking up to the game.  They are choosing to protect themselves.   Even Paul Tudor Jones is a Bitcoiner now. Important message as we enter the next Bitcoin bull market:  - BTC is very volatile - You can lose all of your money - Only invest what is ok to lose - Twitter is not investment advice - Don't buy BTC with credit cards - Keep low time preference - Do your own research Bang Bang .... Paul Tudor Jones buys Bitcoin.  Welcome the the party  Warren Buffett has $137 billion in cash.  That is almost enough to buy every Bitcoin in the circulating supply. Bitcoin shook out the weak hands of Wall Street right before the halving.  You couldnât write a better script  Coinbase has crashed as Bitcoin skyrockets today. S&P 500 YTD:  -23% DJIA YTD:  -16% Bitcoin: YTD:  +11%  Show this to your financial advisor and ask them why they keep ignoring the best performing asset of the last decade. If this video is real, it highlights just how well understood Bitcoin is by the worldâs most powerful people.  The next reserve currency wonât be controlled by a nation state. The Fed's $6 trillion stimulus plan would be enough to buy the entire market cap of Bitcoin more than 48 times. Wall Street will hate it, but nobody has been more right about the macro economy than Gold and Bitcoin investors.  They have been calling for these insane levels of QE for awhile.  Was just a matter of time. 12 month performance of assets:  S&P: - 14% DJIA: - 21% Gold: + 25% Bitcoin: + 69%  Educate yourself. Wall Street ain't looking out for you! The government wants to give stimulus money to Americans through a digital dollar.  This will onboard hundreds of millions of people to Bitcoin. THEY ARE LITERALLY CUTTING RATES AND PRINTING MONEY RIGHT INTO THE BITCOIN HALVING.  Unbelievable. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin just said the Federal Reserve and Treasury are working to provide âunlimited liquidityâ to the financial system.  UNLIMITED LIQUIDITY.  This is going to be the greatest monetary stimulus experiment in history.  Bitcoin was built for this. RUMOR: The Bitcoin CEO has sent a company wide email to all employees to work from home for the rest of the year. Summary of today:  S&P 500 down 7.8% Dow Jones down 7.7% Bitcoin down 5.8%  The stock market was more volatile than Bitcoin.   Stock investors aren't used to this.  Bitcoiners are unfazed by the volatility. Someone tell the Bitcoin detractors that oil just dropped more in a single day than Bitcoin ever has.  Too much volatility!  Scarcity is probably the most important rule in economics.  Many things are scarce â raw materials, precious metals, etc.  Only one asset is PROVABLY scarce though.  It also happens to be fully decentralized & not controlled by any person or group.  Bitcoin is ultimate scarcity. Another company converts their balance sheet capital to Bitcoin.  Gradually, then suddenly  Square started testing Bitcoin purchases in Cash App back in November 2017.  The company's stock is up more than 300% since then.  Last quarter, Cash App generated $875 million of bitcoin revenue and $17 million of bitcoin gross profit.  It pays to embrace Bitcoin. MicroStrategy Inc. is a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ.  Valuation: $1.39 billion 2019 revenue: $486 million # of employees: 2,396  Stock closed today at $143.84 which is about 15% higher than a week ago when they decided to put $250M in balance sheet capital into Bitcoin. Bitcoinâs market cap will surpass goldâs market cap by Dec 31, 2029.  Posting this as a receipt for the future. Everyone laughed when I said gold had infinite supply.  Now people are starting to realize how accurate it was.  Bitcoinâs value is driven by PROVABLE scarcity.  The world has shifted from valuing narratives to valuing truth. Bitcoin doesnât care who the President is [NEW POST] A Public Company Just Converted Their Balance Sheet Cash To Bitcoin As Their Reserve Asset  ""Bitcoin is digital gold â harder, stronger, faster, and smarter than any money that has preceded it."" Bitcoin is the most ruthless asset in the world.  Hits $12,000 and then drops $1,500 in minutes.  Not for the faint of heart. I think Bitcoin is up big today because  @PeterSchiff  went and bought a bunch after our livestream last night. #Bitcoin smashing through $11,000 like the king that it is Bitcoin is currently up more than 50% in 2020.  Crypto continues to be the best performing asset class in this economic recession.  Every investor needs to get off zero. The OCC decision on Bitcoin happened because a Bitcoiner took over the leadership of the organization.  Don't underestimate the change that a single Bitcoiner can drive inside these legacy institutions. Bitcoin letâs you be the bank. Nobody knows if the Federal Reserve is going to print more dollars next week, next month, or later this year.  We know exactly what Bitcoin will be doing though.   Proceed accordingly. Theyâre not making more land and theyâre not making more Bitcoin. Iâm calling it now. On July 1, 2020  @billburr  and  @bertkreischer  kicked off a historic 18 month Bitcoin bull market  Wall Street hates Bitcoin because they worship the Federal Reserve.  They canât believe that an algorithm can do monetary policy better than a bunch of old white dudes in suits and ties. 2020 Year-to-date Performance Summary  S&P:  1% NASDAQ:  2% GOLD:  11% BITCOIN:  35%  Bitcoin has been the best performing asset during the recent crisis. It did exactly what it was supposed to do. What an incredible year it has been for Bitcoin. Enjoy this highlight video from my team  Bitcoinâs market cap is officially higher than Warren Buffettâs Berkshire Hathaway. Can we get $30k bitcoin to end the year?!  Bitcoin just hit another all-time high  Bitcoin and Tesla have been two of the best investments in recent years.  - Both became a meme - Communities are fanatical - Highly disruptive to incumbents - Obvious to young people - Incredibly anti-fragile - Market expanding tech - Multi-decade plays  Innovation drives returns Retweet this if you would move to Miami if Mayor  @FrancisSuarez  put 1% of the cityâs treasury reserves in Bitcoin. My investment thesis is simple:  Find asymmetric upside by identifying opportunities that are contrarian today, but will be consensus in 3-5 years.  Optimize for slugging percentage, not batting average.  Bitcoin was great example. Many more to come. Bitcoin just hit a $500 billion market cap for the first time in history.  RIP bears  Bitcoin just hit a $470 billion market cap for the first time in history.  Half a trillion incoming fast. Bitcoin is up 240% in 2020. $25k on Dec 25th must mean Santa owns Bitcoin Bitcoin making a run at $25k on Christmas night.  You love to see it. Bitcoin hit a $450 billion market cap for the first time in history today. Bitcoin hitting a new all-time on Christmas Day is the energy Iâm here for. Update:  @stoolpresidente  is finally ready to atone for his sins and weak hands.  We're setting up a Bitcoin wallet through  @TheGivingBlock  to help raise money for small businesses via the Barstool Fund.  I'll share the wallet address once we are ready. Stay tuned. The internet will break if Elon Musk converts any of Teslaâs balance sheet into Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a game of accumulation. Bitcoin is now a $420 billion market cap asset. Bitcoin has crossed a $400 billion market cap for the first time in history.   Only 20x away from goldâs market cap... Millions of randos littered throughout the world are beating every hedge fund on Wall Street for a decade plus by just holding Bitcoin.   Welcome to the new world. Many people never believed Bitcoin would hit $1.  Then they didn't believe $10.  Then they didn't believe $100.  Then they didn't believe $1,000.  Then they didn't believe $10,000.  Now they are refusing to believe $100,000.  We'll see :) Morgan Stanley Investment Managementâs chief global strategist is talking about Bitcoin potentially replacing the dollar as the global reserve currency. âNobody is going to ban Bitcoin.â  âWeâre very focused on not killing this.â @BrianBrooksOCC  is doing one hell of a job pushing this whole industry forward right now. Wow. Paul Tudor Jones lays out a belief that Bitcoin is new gold and every sovereign nation will have a digital currency.  Starts around 6 min mark.   Remarkable comments to  @JuliaLaRoche  from one of the legends of Wall Street. BITCOIN JUST HIT A NEW ALL-TIME HIGH  I bought more bitcoin last night.  I bought more bitcoin this morning.  Dollar cost averaging and multi-year time horizons allow you to view price decreases as opportunities to buy a great asset on sale. Do your job and tell your family about Bitcoin this Thanksgiving My friend @michael_saylor continues to be an absolute legend.  This time on CNBC predicting that Apple and others will eventually convert their treasury assets into Bitcoin. In the last 12 months:  - S&P is up 14% - Gold is up 23% - Bitcoin is up 169%  Innovation drives returns and we are witnessing the adoption of one of the most disruptive pieces of technology in real time. JPMorgan now calling for $140k+ Bitcoin price.  Eventually everyone capitulates. JPMorgan market cap: $349 billion Bitcoin market cap: $350 billion  Checkmate, Jamie Dimon. Checkmate. Bitcoin went live on January 3, 2009.  It has been 4,339 days since then.  Bitcoin's market cap is $350 billion today.  That is more than $80 million in market cap added every day on average for 11 years.  $80+ million every single day. Bitcoin just hit a $350 billion market cap for the first time in history. We are about to witness one of the greatest bull markets in financial history.  There is rarely a financial asset that increases in market cap measured in hundreds of billions of dollars over a 12 month period.   It just hit me how historic this Bitcoin bull run will be. Bitcoin is up 154% in 2020. Bitcoin just hit a $325 billion market cap.  This is an all-time high for Bitcoin.  Congratulations to everyone who held through the bear market  LONG BITCOIN, SHORT THE BANKERS Bitcoin up 88% since the halving in May 2020.  Good thing I didn't listen to all those people who said it was priced in! Bitcoin is up 137% in 2020. Square put $50 million of their treasury assets (~ 1%) into Bitcoin on October 8th.  Less than 60 days later it is now worth more than $75 million.  Eventually every individual, company, and central bank will hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset. PayPal bringing Bitcoin and crypto to the masses in record speed  YouTube is down.  Bitcoin is never down. LOL there is a hedge fund manager who was saying Bitcoiners were scam artists & making ridiculous comments in the past on Twitter.  Just saw his fund's returns & Bitcoin outperformed him by 600% in 2019 and more than 1,000% so far this year.  He also deleted all his old tweets  I bought more Bitcoin today. Bitcoin is reminding everyone right now that it doesn't care who the President is. Important message as we enter the next Bitcoin bull market:  - BTC is very volatile - You can lose all of your money - Only invest what is ok to lose - Twitter is not investment advice - Don't buy BTC with credit cards - Keep low time preference - Do your own research Bitcoin is up 98% in 2020. Today is the 12th anniversary of the Bitcoin white paper being published.  That paper will likely go down as one of the most historically important documents in history. Bitcoin is now up 90% in 2020. The internet is going to break when Bitcoin breaks $20,000 ""I like #bitcoin  more now than I did at start. I think we're in the first inning and we have a long way to go.""  Imagine betting against Paul Tudor Jones. BREAKING: PayPal is announcing today that you will be able to buy, sell, and shop with Bitcoin and crypto on their platform.  Game on! Important message as we enter the next Bitcoin bull market:  - BTC is very volatile - You can lose all of your money - Only invest what is ok to lose - Twitter is not investment advice - Don't buy BTC with credit cards - Keep low time preference - Do your own research Someone should crowdfund a Bitcoin Super Bowl commercial I went on CNBC almost a year ago and said that the US must digitize the dollar immediately.  Nobody listened and now the US is behind China.  It ultimately wonât matter though because people will choose Bitcoin. Central banks want central bank digital currencies.  The people already have Bitcoin.  The first has unlimited supply and the second has a capped supply.  Not hard to guess where capital will flow over time. Bitcoin is going to explode when all the suits start buying it $10 billion asset management firm is holding $115 million worth of Bitcoin.  Having 0% exposure to Bitcoin at this point is the wrong answer. At this point, youâre violating your fiduciary duty if you invest capital on behalf of an institution & you have no exposure to Bitcoin.  Your job is to find the best risk-adjusted returns.  Nothing better than Bitcoin.   About time we all start saying it loudly, so they listen. Bitcoin waking up and reminding everyone why it is king  Everyone is looking at Square's Bitcoin purchase, but this may be more bullish:  ""Square has open sourced documentation to articulate the process behind the execution of its purchase as others consider similar strategies. The whitepaper can be found at http://squareup.com/investors."" Individuals have been using Bitcoin as a reserve asset for awhile.  Corporations are right at the beginning of using Bitcoin as a reserve asset now.  Eventually central banks will use Bitcoin as a reserve asset as well.  Just a matter of time. BREAKING: Square has invested $50 million in Bitcoin and will hold the digital currency on their balance sheet.  Every corporation will eventually do this.  @jack  continuing to lead the way! REMINDER: Bitcoin is how you opt out of this nonsense Dear Bitcoin haters,  Bitcoin has spent a record 63 straight days above $10,000 and is only showing signs of going higher.  The market is proving your bearishness wrong. There is always time to capitulate & join the party :)  Love, Pomp Stock markets are closed.  Banks are closed.  Bitcoin is never closed. New episode with @michael_saylor is now live!  We discuss how Michael built MicroStrategy, what his $500 million dilemma earlier this year was, and why he choose to put more than $400 million into Bitcoin with the company's balance sheet.

There is rarely a financial asset that increases in market cap measured in hundreds of billions of dollars over a 12 month period.   It just hit me how historic this Bitcoin bull run will be. Bitcoin is up 154% in 2020. Bitcoin just hit a $325 billion market cap.  This is an all-time high for Bitcoin.  Congratulations to everyone who held through the bear market  LONG BITCOIN, SHORT THE BANKERS Bitcoin up 88% since the halving in May 2020.  Good thing I didn't listen to all those people who said it was priced in! Bitcoin is up 137% in 2020. Square put $50 million of their treasury assets (~ 1%) into Bitcoin on October 8th.  Less than 60 days later it is now worth more than $75 million.  Eventually every individual, company, and central bank will hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset. PayPal bringing Bitcoin and crypto to the masses in record speed  YouTube is down.  Bitcoin is never down. LOL there is a hedge fund manager who was saying Bitcoiners were scam artists & making ridiculous comments in the past on Twitter.  Just saw his fund's returns & Bitcoin outperformed him by 600% in 2019 and more than 1,000% so far this year.  He also deleted all his old tweets  I bought more Bitcoin today. Bitcoin is reminding everyone right now that it doesn't care who the President is. Important message as we enter the next Bitcoin bull market:  - BTC is very volatile - You can lose all of your money - Only invest what is ok to lose - Twitter is not investment advice - Don't buy BTC with credit cards - Keep low time preference - Do your own research Bitcoin is up 98% in 2020. Today is the 12th anniversary of the Bitcoin white paper being published.  That paper will likely go down as one of the most historically important documents in history. Bitcoin is now up 90% in 2020. The internet is going to break when Bitcoin breaks $20,000 ""I like #bitcoin  more now than I did at start. I think we're in the first inning and we have a long way to go.""  Imagine betting against Paul Tudor Jones. BREAKING: PayPal is announcing today that you will be able to buy, sell, and shop with Bitcoin and crypto on their platform.  Game on! Important message as we enter the next Bitcoin bull market:  - BTC is very volatile - You can lose all of your money - Only invest what is ok to lose - Twitter is not investment advice - Don't buy BTC with credit cards - Keep low time preference - Do your own research Someone should crowdfund a Bitcoin Super Bowl commercial I went on CNBC almost a year ago and said that the US must digitize the dollar immediately.  Nobody listened and now the US is behind China.  It ultimately wonât matter though because people will choose Bitcoin. Central banks want central bank digital currencies.  The people already have Bitcoin.  The first has unlimited supply and the second has a capped supply.  Not hard to guess where capital will flow over time. Bitcoin is going to explode when all the suits start buying it $10 billion asset management firm is holding $115 million worth of Bitcoin.  Having 0% exposure to Bitcoin at this point is the wrong answer. At this point, youâre violating your fiduciary duty if you invest capital on behalf of an institution & you have no exposure to Bitcoin.  Your job is to find the best risk-adjusted returns.  Nothing better than Bitcoin.   About time we all start saying it loudly, so they listen. Bitcoin waking up and reminding everyone why it is king  Everyone is looking at Square's Bitcoin purchase, but this may be more bullish:  ""Square has open sourced documentation to articulate the process behind the execution of its purchase as others consider similar strategies. The whitepaper can be found at http://squareup.com/investors."" Individuals have been using Bitcoin as a reserve asset for awhile.  Corporations are right at the beginning of using Bitcoin as a reserve asset now.  Eventually central banks will use Bitcoin as a reserve asset as well.  Just a matter of time. BREAKING: Square has invested $50 million in Bitcoin and will hold the digital currency on their balance sheet.  Every corporation will eventually do this.  @jack  continuing to lead the way! REMINDER: Bitcoin is how you opt out of this nonsense Dear Bitcoin haters,  Bitcoin has spent a record 63 straight days above $10,000 and is only showing signs of going higher.  The market is proving your bearishness wrong. There is always time to capitulate & join the party :)  Love, Pomp Stock markets are closed.  Banks are closed.  Bitcoin is never closed. New episode with @michael_saylor is now live!  We discuss how Michael built MicroStrategy, what his $500 million dilemma earlier this year was, and why he choose to put more than $400 million into Bitcoin with the company's balance sheet.  Enjoy :) Retweet this tweet if you think it is time for  @stoolpresidente  to come on the podcast and learn Bitcoin ",INFP,0.0614

100trillionUSD,"Where I live the entire yieldcurve is negative: 1Y interest rate, 5Y, 10Y, 30Y all below zero. Soon in US too. This is a problem because banks already charge negative rates on savings accounts. Also, pension funds have trouble making enough return. #Bitcoin could be the solution. #bitcoin $10k ... it's getting really interesting now Ignore the noise, focus on the signal #bitcoin #S2F Something has changed this week: I have been approached every day by friends and colleagues to buy bitcoin, every single day! This has not happened in 2018 or 2019. People seem to start allocating serious ""what the fuck money"" to bitcoin, getting off zero, working on their planB. Few people realize we are currently in the third best #bitcoin month ever. Only Dec 2017 ($13.880) and June 2019 ($10.760) closed higher. #BTC looking strong, RSI>60 *** Update: my 2 sats on #bitcoin price: - 2020: btc stays above $8200 (so we are NOT dropping to $6k or $4k levels that others are predicting now) - May 2020 halving: will be above $10k - 2021: bull run starts after the halving and tops $100k before Dec 2021 #NotFinancialAdvice #bitcoin 200 week moving average has never gone down, currently increasing at $200 (4%) per month #bitcoin halving 3 months to go .. now above S2F model value Hypothesis: #bitcoin keeps rising as long as FED, ECB and PBOC keep printing. IMO #bitcoin risk is OVERestimated, and risk of current financial system collapsing is UNDERestimated https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/efficient-market-hypothesis-and-bitcoin-stock-to-flow-model-db17f40e6107â¦ My second #bitcoin article! ""Efficient Market Hypothesis and Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Model"". Looking at arbitrage, risk & return models and derivative markets. Governments are weaponizing money, thereby degrading it to function as money. Today Iran, tomorrow they cut you off. Protect yourself with #bitcoin IMO co-integration between #bitcoin price & stock-to-flow means all network effects march lockstep: Investors, Speculators, Merchants, Consumers, Miners and Developers together ... demand & supply, like clockwork! #bitcoin is already the best performing asset of this decade #Bitcoin S2F chart update .. RED DOT RELEASED!!! ICYMI: there are more than 200,000 high ultra high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI: >$30M) in the world. If they buy #bitcoin they don't buy 1 or 2 BTC, they buy more. What if 10% of UHNWI decides it might be wise to get some? An now we wait ... #bitcoin #RSI60+ ""Yesterday was the halvening [..] so the stock-to-flow has now gone up"" #bitcoin #Phase5 ""The best profit-maximizing strategy is to own the fastest horse [..] if I am forced to forecast, my bet is it will be Bitcoin.â - Paul Tudor Jones My third #bitcoin article! ""Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Cross Asset Model (S2FX)"". Looking at stock-to-flow, phase transitions, cluster analysis, silver and gold. #Bitcoin Stock To Flow (S2F) Indicator: Now Live on Kraken's  @cryptowat_ch buy bitcoin   (h/t  @ercwl ) #bitcoin priced in gold (BTCXAU) ... at lowest level in 4 years. Stock-to-Flow suggest BCT or gold #Bitcoin halving in 35, 34, 33 ... ""Itâs better to be approximately right than exactly wrong"" - Carveth Read. #Bitcoin S2F model is not dead accurate, but order of magnitude right. So #btc has been oscillating around S2F value of $7000 for 2.5 years now. Just like before 2016 halving ($300) and before 2012 halving ($6). Excited to see if we are going to add another zero after the halving in May Advice for #bitcoin newbies 1) read Whitepaper https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/bitcoin.pdfâ¦ 2) read Bullish Case for Bitcoin https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin/â¦ 3) read BitGold https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bit-gold/ 4) read about Social Scalability https://nakamotoinstitute.org/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability/â¦ 5) follow BTC top100 on twitter https://hive.one/bitcoin/ #Bitcoin halvings coincide with US presidential elections (2012, 2016, 2020 etc) .. chance or Satoshi's genius? WHY #BITCOIN IS BEATING GOLD #Bitcoin Difficulty still +7% YTD. Hashrate currently 100EH/s. Looks like 2012 & 2016 halving: no death spiral or miner capitulation. So the FED just went full Zimbabwe .. less than 50 days until the halving?!!! Chart updated @ #BTC $6300 One more thing about #bitcoin stock-to-flow model: the important thing is not S2F sec (it's determined, fixed in code), but the fact that btc price (demand & supply) tracks S2F like clockwork, i.e. the cointegration. Why? Scarcity, network effects, hodlers, QE ... time will tell. Must read thread. This is exactly how I see current financial markets as well. #bitcoin might be(come) the last asset not yet mortgaged. Some people think S2F model broke yesterday. Of course it did not. #bitcoin oscillated nicely around model value and stayed well within model bands. The extreme volatility within the model bands shakes out the weak hands. No extreme returns without extreme risk (volatility). #btc at $5800 .. model (co-integration) still fine #bitcoin S2F chart adjusted for today's ""crash"" ... nothing really happened, btc still spot on S2F track Tomorrow's #bitcoin difficulty adjustment (which keeps time between blocks at 10 minutes, regardless of hashrate) will be a massive +7%! No sign of weakness 2 months before the halving.  https://diff.cryptothis.com Remember last month's forecast that #bitcoin will stay above $8200? So far so good and .. the indicator just flipped to $8600 (March close). Risky with btc now at $8475, but I like to share it as out-of-sample test. Note this is totally different from S2F! #Bitcoin  halving 2 months to go .. 2 more blue dots, then RED  For new followers: - Original S2F model article (22/3/2019): https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25â¦ - S2F model and EMH article (17/1/2020): https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/efficient-market-hypothesis-and-bitcoin-stock-to-flow-model-db17f40e6107â¦ Must read: #Bitcoin Investment Cases of Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, MicroStrategy https://github.com/100trillionUSD/bitcoinâ¦ Friday Fun: modeling #bitcoin price with central bank balance sheets (FED+ECB). 90% R2. Recent QE fueled explosion of FED and ECB balance sheets to $7T and $6.4T implies a BTC price of ... $20M In fact .. Nasdaq is now 1.15% Bitcoin Watch FED Jerome Powell pumping #bitcoin live! This is a game changer: Nasdaq listed company with $250M bitcoin (25% of assets, 15% of market cap) is basically a bitcoin ETF!  Shareholders have 15% BTC exposure and 85% tech. No capital charges (like banks & pension funds), no SEC approval needed (like ETF)  So it begins #Bitcoin Asymmetric Return  Last 10 years (2011-2020): - 2 years negative return (2014, 2018) - 3 years [+25% -> +100%] return (2015, 2019, 2020) - 5 years >100% return (of which 3 yrs >1000% return!) Very interesting to see Grayscale Investment's view on #bitcoin and stock to flow: ""Commodities with high stock-to-flow ratios such as Bitcoin, gold, and silver have historically been utilized as stores of value"" https://grayscale.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Grayscale_Valuing_Bitcoin.pdf?utm_medium=email&utm_source=lifecycle&utm_campaign=form-conf_valuing-btcâ¦ ICYMI: #bitcoin is nicely moving away from 200 week moving average. 200WMA is currently $6400, is increasing $200 per month, and has never decreased. Best of all, BTC monthly close has never been below 200WMA. #Bitcoin looking strong, RSI 64, bull market confirmed Taking USD out of the equation: 1 BTC = 6 ounces of gold .. and rising 3rd red dot (currently $11850) above 2nd red dot (#bitcoin July close $11356) and above 1st red dot (June close $9132) .. next target: Dec 2017 ATH close $14K  When bitcoin was $4k in 2019, lot of big accounts were bearish, predicting $1k. However in DM mant said that if btc would rise to $6k, they would reconsider and switch to bull. That actually happened, we shot through $6k. Now many were bearish at $9k .. $13.5k will be interesting S&P500 from $1000 to $3000 #BTC from $1 to $10.000 Few understand this S&P500 and Bitcoin have been correlated and co-integrated last 10 years. S&P implied BTC price: $25K .. interesting times ahead! Lot of people think that June & July bitcoin dots being under S2FX model line, means bitcoin has diminishing returns. That is not correct. The 3 horizontal parts (blue line) are the 3 halvings, where S2F doubles immediately. Price moves up to model line in the months after (red). BTC phase1:  S2F1.3  $1M BTC phase2:  S2F3.3  $60M BTC phase3:  S2F10  $5B BTC phase4:  S2F25  $114B Silver:  S2F33  $560B Diamonds:  S2F42  $1T Gold:  S2F60  $9T Real Estate:  S2F95  $108T  -> Power Law: S2F 2X = Market Value 18X (2^4.1492)  BTC phase5 (~ 2020-2014): S2F56 $ ... Boom .. all time high bitcoin difficulty: 17345948872516.06 9,000 blocks into the 4th epoch, #bitcoin at $9,250 3rd epoch $8,572 2nd epoch $638 1st epoch $12 What are the odds of a country using #bitcoin as currency? - Oil producing country that wants BTC (not $) for oil - One of 168 countries with lower monetary base than BTC - Hyperinflation country - US sanctioned country (cut off SWIFT) - A high tech country (next Silicon Valley) For historical purposes only: #bitcoin is at the same price level as 27 Nov 2017 .. it took 20 DAYS to go to $19K Why I bought #bitcoin in 2015-2016 (before the model): - 46M millionaires in the world, only 21M BTC - can't use gold or $ in space or Mars, need something else - nobody can freeze account or block transactions - 0% interest rate is better than negative interest rate S&P $4000 !! That makes BTC = 4000^8.7*e^-60 = $190K  #SP500BTCcointegration #BTC= $3100^8.7*e^-60 = $20K ICYMI Satoshi Feb2009 ""I've developed a new open source P2P e-cash system called Bitcoin [..] - completely decentralized - no central server - no trusted parties - based on crypto proof instead of trust - problem with conventional currency is [debasement]"" https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/p2pfoundation/1/â¦ âDonât Fight the FEDâ is old Wall Street wisdom.  Great thing that #Bitcoin is fully aligned with FED interests (QE to save banks & companies). BTC is correlated (95% R2) and cointegrated with US equities (S&P500). So BTC is not an uncorrelated asset and supported by FED actions. ICYMI - #Bitcoin and S&P500 are correlated (95% R2) and cointegrated (so probably not spurious) - Current S&P level implies BTC $18K (or S&P to go down) - This is consistent with S2FX model: $288K BTC at S2F56 -> it implies $4300 S&P - Money printing (QE) pumps both S&P and BTC #Bitcoin S2FX Phases 1: Pizza, GPU miner, Silk Road, MtGox 2: >$1, Wikileaks, Satoshi Dice, Coinbase, Halving1 3: >$100, Cyprus, Bitstamp, Ulbricht arrest, MtGox default, XT fork, Halving2 4: >$1000, JPN&AUS legalize BTC, Altcoins/ICO, BCH/SV forks, Segwit/LN, Futures, Halving3 #Bitcoin looking sharp after shrugging off: - 2017 CME futures FOMO & hangover - 2018 US government ICO crackdown - 2018 SEC approval ETF hope & delusion  - 2018 BSV fork - 2019 Bakkt futures fear & relieve - 2020 Corona virus #Bitcoin priced in Gold .. USD out of the equation IMO investors cannot ignore this. If you dollar cost average into #bitcoin for 12 months, then wait 12 months, and then DCA out 12 months, this chart shows your return (investment=1). So DCA in 2017, wait 2018, DCA out 2019 yields 1.7 or +70% return.  Odds:  13% <1 19% 1-2 68% >2 Forbes on #Bitcoin Stock-To-Flow In 2017 #bitcoin jumped from $10K to $16.6K in 7 days (and to $20K ATH in 17 days) See the two blue dots on the right? That's May and June, zooming in on post-halving S2F level of 50+. Next: market value .. #bitcoin phase5 in the making! For the connoisseurs: red dot on #bitcoin S2FX model, will this be the start of the bull market again? In 2012-2013 and 2016-2017 red dots started the transition to a new phase. #Phase5  #bitcoin = 15 ounces of gold. Up from 5 ounces end 2019 and 3 in 2018. Note there is no USD in this formula or chart. This is the pure S2F effect without QE / Brrr. 100x gold implies $188K bitcoin (at current gold prices; gold will probably increase in price due to QE). #bitcoin bull run picking up steam #Bitcoin versus FED+ECB balance sheet (QE)  In case you have not read the original #bitcoin S2F and S2FX model articles, you can find them here: https://100trillionusd.github.io #bitcoin price $25.3K above S2F model value $24.9K real time S2F charts: https://digitalik.net/btc/ #Bitcoin $24K, Merry Christmas! #bitcoin 200WMA increasing faster and faster #bitcoin looking strong, despite US KYC/AML crap #phase5 $1B in #Bitcoin . âThere is going to be a generational allocation to this new asset class. The flows have only just begun.â - CEO Eric Peters Chart update: #bitcoin S2F (time series only) model. BTC price (red dots) moves nicely towards model line (white line), just like 2017 and 2013. And .. do I see a little orange? #bitcoin outperforms ALL other assets: more return AND less risk (yes you read that correctly ""less risk"") ""It might make sense just to get some [#bitcoin] in case it catches on. If enough people [and companies] think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling prophecy."" - Satoshi Nakamoto #bitcoin pausing before orange and yellow Watch how traders, shitcoiners and weak hands transfer their #bitcoin to strong hands like Grayscale, Paypal, Square, MicroStrategy etc. These BTC will disappear from the market and go into deep cold storage and stay there for years. #bitcoin 200WMA $7500 (monthly increase 5.5%), looks like late 2016 / early 2017. #bitcoin and central bank balance sheets (money 'printing') have gone hand in hand last 10 years .. but now BTC is lagging behind .. about two orders of magnitude (100X). Room for growth? #bitcoin looking strong, RSI 75, when RSI 95? #bitcoin stock-to-flow cross asset model -if BTC doesn't break it's historical path -BTC market cap will approach gold market value $5-10T in 2021-2024 -and approach real estate market value $10-100T in 2024-2028 -after 2028 we can no longer interpolate and enter uncharted waters Tomorrow is Monday! Paypal, Grayscale, Square etc will resume buying #bitcoin. Are you ready? #Bitcoin is a fast growing country in cyberspace, with a population of sovereign individuals who prefer to use BTC for storing wealth and doing transactions: - monetary base $330B (#34 largest country) - population 10M (#92 largest country of the world) https://cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2215rank.htmlâ¦ It always amuses my when there is simultaneous China FUD and government banning / regulating FUD on illiquid #bitcoin market moments (Thanksgiving etc). Classic. Don't let them take your coins. #phase5 ""Are you a software company or a bitcoin hedge fund?"" #phase5  ""Physically backed (100% Bitcoin collateralized)"" US soon? Slowly but surely this is beginning to look like (the start of) a bull market. Best ever #bitcoin month in $ terms (+$5400) and RSI crawling towards bull market levels. Current #bitcoin price action is nice, but we are waiting for a real jump (like the red arrows early 2013 and 2017). IMO that will be the start of the real bull market, and indeed phase5. January 2021? ""Bitcoin actually is the scarcest asset in the world, based on stock-to-flow measure""  @MarkYusko #bitcoin $18K. Big difference with 2017 is that most BTC sold today will never see the daylight again, they disappear into deep cold storage. Buyers today are professionals with long term vision and staying power. 1 month later #bitcoin is 9 ounces of gold .. significant indeed  Beautiful to see the birth of #bitcoin phase5 in real time! Red dots will tun orange, yellow, green and slowly crawl towards S2FX model line (black linear line) and gold. #bitcoin Chart update of the #bitcoin S2F (time series only) model. Price dots moving nicely towards model line. S2F multiple (white dots) rising. #bitcoin monthly RSI>70 .. momentum is building Now watch how those bitcoins that some dumb weak hand sellers sold in big chucks last 4 hours will be sucked up by strong hand buyers with hundreds of smart small 0.01 BTC algo buys. Those BTC will disappear in deep cold storage People ask if I still believe in my model. To be clear: I have no doubt whatsoever that #bitcoin S2FX is correct and #bitcoin will tap $100K-288K before Dec2021. In fact I have new data that confirms the supply shortage is real. IMO 2021 will be spectacular. Not financial advice! #bitcoin $15K Best present on #Bitcoin whitepaper day! Recent rise in #bitcoin price and drop in gold price, increased the price of bitcoin to 7 ounces of gold. IMO this is significant. #bitcoin OK, we can forget this Paypal ""news"".  ""Crypto in [the Paypal]  account cannot be transferred to other accounts on or off PayPal.""  So, this is all a big PayPal nothing burger, just entries in a central PayPal database, nothing to do with #bitcoin #bitcoin priced in gold. Will this trend continue? #bitcoin$11k, final countdown  h/t  @BitcoinMemeHub   sound on! I like Adam's comparison of S2FX model to Moore's Law, an observation and a projection. What gives me even more confidence in S2FX: Moore's law is an EXTRApolation, but S2FX is an INTERpolation: we have data points beyond current #BTC range (silver, gold, diamonds, real estate). $10900 (Oct actual) $10778 (Sept close) $11655 (Aug close) $11356 (Jul close) $9132 (Jun close)  September red dot below August, bummer, but no worries. This also happened in January and March 2017. In fact, it marked 2017 #bitcoin phase transition Beautiful to see #bitcoin network effect keeping BTC on the same Stock2Flow-Value track as other monetary commodities like silver and gold. Just look at the data/chart, no model or math needed. #bitcoin mining: difficulty op +20% after halving .. like clockwork ""First I study this stuff, and I got introduced to stock to flow, and all in a sudden I am looking at PlanB [..] and then I start doing the math [..] and then I realize [..] #bitcoin is doing the bidding of mother nature."" #Bitcoin relative strength index (RSI) almost 3 years <65. Do you think we will stay there forever .. or do we enter a >65 period next?  Why did $425M MSTR buy not move #bitcoin price up? Because they bought carefully, thousands of small incognito algo orders over a period of weeks.

So #btc has been oscillating around S2F value of $7000 for 2.5 years now. Just like before 2016 halving ($300) and before 2012 halving ($6). Excited to see if we are going to add another zero after the halving in May Advice for #bitcoin newbies 1) read Whitepaper https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/bitcoin.pdfâ¦ 2) read Bullish Case for Bitcoin https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin/â¦ 3) read BitGold https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bit-gold/ 4) read about Social Scalability https://nakamotoinstitute.org/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability/â¦ 5) follow BTC top100 on twitter https://hive.one/bitcoin/ #Bitcoin halvings coincide with US presidential elections (2012, 2016, 2020 etc) .. chance or Satoshi's genius?

So the FED just went full Zimbabwe .. less than 50 days until the halving?!!! Chart updated @ #BTC $6300 One more thing about #bitcoin stock-to-flow model: the important thing is not S2F sec (it's determined, fixed in code), but the fact that btc price (demand & supply) tracks S2F like clockwork, i.e. the cointegration. Why? Scarcity, network effects, hodlers, QE ... time will tell. Must read thread. This is exactly how I see current financial markets as well. #bitcoin might be(come) the last asset not yet mortgaged. Some people think S2F model broke yesterday. Of course it did not. #bitcoin oscillated nicely around model value and stayed well within model bands. The extreme volatility within the model bands shakes out the weak hands. No extreme returns without extreme risk (volatility). #btc at $5800 .. model (co-integration) still fine #bitcoin S2F chart adjusted for today's ""crash"" ... nothing really happened, btc still spot on S2F track Tomorrow's #bitcoin difficulty adjustment (which keeps time between blocks at 10 minutes, regardless of hashrate) will be a massive +7%! No sign of weakness 2 months before the halving.  https://diff.cryptothis.com Remember last month's forecast that #bitcoin will stay above $8200? So far so good and .. the indicator just flipped to $8600 (March close). Risky with btc now at $8475, but I like to share it as out-of-sample test. Note this is totally different from S2F! #Bitcoin  halving 2 months to go .. 2 more blue dots, then RED  For new followers: - Original S2F model article (22/3/2019): https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25â¦ - S2F model and EMH article (17/1/2020): https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/efficient-market-hypothesis-and-bitcoin-stock-to-flow-model-db17f40e6107â¦ Must read: #Bitcoin Investment Cases of Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, MicroStrategy https://github.com/100trillionUSD/bitcoinâ¦ Friday Fun: modeling #bitcoin price with central bank balance sheets (FED+ECB). 90% R2.

Best of all, BTC monthly close has never been below 200WMA. #Bitcoin looking strong, RSI 64, bull market confirmed Taking USD out of the equation: 1 BTC = 6 ounces of gold .. and rising 3rd red dot (currently $11850) above 2nd red dot (#bitcoin July close $11356) and above 1st red dot (June close $9132) .. next target: Dec 2017 ATH close $14K  When bitcoin was $4k in 2019, lot of big accounts were bearish, predicting $1k. However in DM mant said that if btc would rise to $6k, they would reconsider and switch to bull. That actually happened, we shot through $6k. Now many were bearish at $9k .. $13.5k will be interesting S&P500 from $1000 to $3000 #BTC from $1 to $10.000 Few understand this S&P500 and Bitcoin have been correlated and co-integrated last 10 years. S&P implied BTC price: $25K .. interesting times ahead! Lot of people think that June & July bitcoin dots being under S2FX model line, means bitcoin has diminishing returns. That is not correct.

Great thing that #Bitcoin is fully aligned with FED interests (QE to save banks & companies). BTC is correlated (95% R2) and cointegrated with US equities (S&P500). So BTC is not an uncorrelated asset and supported by FED actions. ICYMI - #Bitcoin and S&P500 are correlated (95% R2) and cointegrated (so probably not spurious) - Current S&P level implies BTC $18K (or S&P to go down) - This is consistent with S2FX model: $288K BTC at S2F56 -> it implies $4300 S&P - Money printing (QE) pumps both S&P and BTC #Bitcoin S2FX Phases 1: Pizza, GPU miner, Silk Road, MtGox 2: >$1, Wikileaks, Satoshi Dice, Coinbase, Halving1 3: >$100, Cyprus, Bitstamp, Ulbricht arrest, MtGox default, XT fork, Halving2 4: >$1000, JPN&AUS legalize BTC, Altcoins/ICO, BCH/SV forks, Segwit/LN, Futures, Halving3 #Bitcoin looking sharp after shrugging off: - 2017 CME futures FOMO & hangover - 2018 US government ICO crackdown - 2018 SEC approval ETF hope & delusion  - 2018 BSV fork - 2019 Bakkt futures fear & relieve - 2020 Corona virus #Bitcoin priced in Gold ..

Note there is no USD in this formula or chart. This is the pure S2F effect without QE / Brrr. 100x gold implies $188K bitcoin (at current gold prices; gold will probably increase in price due to QE). #bitcoin bull run picking up steam #Bitcoin versus FED+ECB balance sheet (QE)  In case you have not read the original #bitcoin S2F and S2FX model articles, you can find them here: https://100trillionusd.github.io #bitcoin price $25.3K above S2F model value $24.9K real time S2F charts: https://digitalik.net/btc/ #Bitcoin $24K, Merry Christmas! #bitcoin 200WMA increasing faster and faster #bitcoin looking strong, despite US KYC/AML crap #phase5 $1B in #Bitcoin . âThere is going to be a generational allocation to this new asset class.

Current #bitcoin price action is nice, but we are waiting for a real jump (like the red arrows early 2013 and 2017). IMO that will be the start of the real bull market, and indeed phase5. January 2021? ""Bitcoin actually is the scarcest asset in the world, based on stock-to-flow measure""  @MarkYusko #bitcoin $18K. Big difference with 2017 is that most BTC sold today will never see the daylight again, they disappear into deep cold storage. Buyers today are professionals with long term vision and staying power. 1 month later #bitcoin is 9 ounces of gold .. significant indeed  Beautiful to see the birth of #bitcoin phase5 in real time! Red dots will tun orange, yellow, green and slowly crawl towards S2FX model line (black linear line) and gold. #bitcoin Chart update of the #bitcoin S2F (time series only) model. Price dots moving nicely towards model line. S2F multiple (white dots) rising. #bitcoin monthly RSI>70 .. momentum is building Now watch how those bitcoins that some dumb weak hand sellers sold in big chucks last 4 hours will be sucked up by strong hand buyers with hundreds of smart small 0.01 BTC algo buys. Those BTC will disappear in deep cold storage People ask if I still believe in my model. To be clear: I have no doubt whatsoever that #bitcoin S2FX is correct and #bitcoin will tap $100K-288K before Dec2021. In fact I have new data that confirms the supply shortage is real. IMO 2021 will be spectacular. Not financial advice! #bitcoin $15K Best present on #Bitcoin whitepaper day! Recent rise in #bitcoin price and drop in gold price, increased the price of bitcoin to 7 ounces of gold. IMO this is significant. #bitcoin OK, we can forget this Paypal ""news"".

So, this is all a big PayPal nothing burger, just entries in a central PayPal database, nothing to do with #bitcoin #bitcoin priced in gold. Will this trend continue? #bitcoin$11k, final countdown  h/t  @BitcoinMemeHub   sound on! I like Adam's comparison of S2FX model to Moore's Law, an observation and a projection. What gives me even more confidence in S2FX: Moore's law is an EXTRApolation, but S2FX is an INTERpolation: we have data points beyond current #BTC range (silver, gold, diamonds, real estate). $10900 (Oct actual) $10778 (Sept close) $11655 (Aug close) $11356 (Jul close) $9132 (Jun close)  September red dot below August, bummer, but no worries. This also happened in January and March 2017. In fact, it marked 2017 #bitcoin phase transition Beautiful to see #bitcoin network effect keeping BTC on the same Stock2Flow-Value track as other monetary commodities like silver and gold.

tyler,"At some point people will wake up and realize that bitcoin is the best safe haven asset the world has ever seen. Until then, opportunity abounds. Crypto used to be where you ended up when you couldnât make it on Wall Street. The quality of Goldman Sachsâ recent research on #Bitcoin demonstrates that there has been a talent flippening. Today, Wall Street is where you end up when you canât make it in crypto. Goldman Sachs aka Bankers aka Wall Street still don't get (or want to get) #Bitcoin. It's ok, because everyone else does. This may cause some governments to rethink their gold strategy. #Bitcoin The Internet has made it possible for you to become your own broadcaster and media empire (e.g.,  @joerogan ). Bitcoin allows you to become your own bank. I love the freedom and independence that technology can bring to the world. Bitcoin is not magic, funny money. That's the U.S. dollar and the Fed cc  @jk_rowling . The Bitcoin Halving was momentous, I'm still soaking it all in. It's incredible to think of just how much a crazy band of believers accomplished in the last 4 years. The most exciting part? We're just beginning... One of the smartest and most successful investors of the last quarter century is now long Bitcoin. Wall Street is coming...  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-tudor-jones-buys-bitcoin-165520128.htmlâ¦ The Fed has set the stage for the rise of bitcoin; the pandemic has set the stage for the rise of Big Brother.  For something that has ""died"" so many times, bitcoin sure is stayin' alive. Bitcoin is not a hedge to pandemics, it is a hedge to fiat regimes. A sudden, negative demand shock in the global economyâ will affect every asset, including gold, in the short term. Bitcoin was born in 2008, during the winter of our financial discontent. It has already weathered much to be here, and it seems unlikely to give up anytime soon. It will emerge from this current calamity stronger than ever. Decades are not measured in days. The Fed, under the leadership of Jerome Powell, continues to be #Bitcoin's biggest booster. On Thursday, he will deliver a speech about how the Fed will begin targeting higher inflation.  I am COVID negative. The only thing I have is the #Bitcoin and crypto virus which I gave to  @stoolpresidente . Itâs overwhelming at first, but once you start stacking sats, you will have long term immunity to all of the insanity in the world. I always get excited when #Bitcoin hovers around a price level for a while. Like a caged animal, it's getting more and more ready to break out. Attention #Bitcoin newcomers, you don't have to buy a full bitcoin, you can buy any fraction of a bitcoin that you want â even as little as 0.00000001 (called a ""satoshi"") is possible. This is what Bitcoiners mean when they say they're ""stacking satoshis"" or ""stacking sats."" #Bitcoin rocketing through 12K on Monday morning is much more energizing and a large cold brew. #DDTG aka  @stoolpresidente  is diving headfirst into #Bitcoin  #Bitcoin is the only long-term hedge to all the inflation that's coming... People ask me all the time if it's too late to buy #Bitcoin. I tell them that it's the bottom of the first inning and that one day they'll look back and understand just how early it is. #Bitcoin is the greatest social network of all time. #Bitcoin is gold with wings. And #Bitcoin has breached 12k. Great way to start the week! Now Goldman Sachs is into #Bitcoin. What an about face from their ""Don't Buy Bitcoin"" Report issued 3 months ago in May. Nice head fake vampire squid. Tomorrow, they will be changing their name to ""Goldman Stacking Sats.""  https://msn.com/en-us/money/markets/goldman-names-new-head-of-digital-assets-in-bet-that-blockchain-is-the-future-of-financial-markets/ar-BB17Eq0hâ¦ There are times on the #Bitcoin journey that can be lonely. Your friends think youâre crazy, people ridicule you. But weâre entering a time period when again Bitcoiners will be considered the smartest people in the room. #Bitcoin is the most inclusive investment and financial asset that world has ever seen. Bitcoin is mooning Bitcoin will set you free When money printer go brrrr and inflate the stonks market, itâs time to bitcoin. Bitcoin is trending. Earlier today, Twitter accounts were hijacked in an attempt to trick individuals into sending bitcoin to addresses owned by the attackers.  @Gemini  immediately added these addresses to our blocklist to prevent our customers from inadvertently falling victim to this scam. Bitcoin marks the beginning of the end for surveillance capitalism. This is why bitcoin is gold 2.0. Itâs mathematically impossible to counterfeit. Bitcoin requires no guns, government money does. Which do you think is stronger? Bitcoin is the first time in the history of the world that people have reached peaceful agreement around billions of dollars in economic value. The price of ether $ETH right now is $735. This is 51% off of its all-time-high, which is like buying #Bitcoin at 14k. What a steal. Iâm going to break 300k followers by the New Year and #Bitcoin is going to break 30k. Letâs get this party started  The #Bitcoin price has appreciated 300% this year #Bitcoinâs market cap is 500 billion. Goldâs market cap is 9 trillion. Thatâs atleast 18x appreciation from here when bitcoin disrupts gold. #Bitcoinâs market cap is now 500 billion. Itâs impact will be far more profound than any company, yet there are companies 2x more valuable than it. Itâs still so early #StimulusCheck is trending right now, which means #Bitcoin will be trending and pumping again soon #Bitcoin just finished day at highest close ever Merry Christmas! No coal this year, #Bitcoin 24.5k instead  Ho ho ho!  Staggering fact I can stop thinking about. Today, debt-to-GDP ratio is 135%. It was 121% during WWII. Back then we had record employment and record production. Today, we have record unemployment and low production. #Bitcoin is the only compass to navigate these uncharted waters. When  @elonmusk  puts the $TSLA balance sheet into #Bitcoin, we'll have to change the BTC rallying cry from ""to the moon!"" to ""to Mars!"" #Bitcoin is the perfect hedge for these times Every high net worth and ultra high net worth individual in the world heard about #Bitcoin in 2017. This is the first time they are actually doing something about it and buying it in bulk. Another highly sophisticated hedge fund is buying 1 billion worth of #Bitcoin and #Ether  âThere is going to be a generational allocation to this new asset class,â Peters said. âThe flows have only just begun.â In the future, the period in U.S. history known as the 'Roaring Twenties' will be about #Bitcoin Btw, #Bitcoin is just getting started How #Bitcoin stacks up against the rest #Bitcoin has just breached 21k! To moon we go! #Bitcoin is has reached a new all-time-high, having busted through 20k. Smartest people in the room are jumping into #Bitcoin #Bitcoin street art in the heart of Hong Kong. Spartans HODL! Everyone is excited that the stock market is all time highs. Thatâs wonderful, but these are fantasy gains inflated and pumped up by the Fedâs money printing.   Meanwhile, #Bitcoin has grown by 15x more with no money printing at all. Thatâs real. If #Bitcoin is only used a store of value, it will be conservatively worth 500k per bitcoin one day. If it also becomes widely used as a medium of exchange, the price will be much higher. ""Digital currencies such as #Bitcoin are making the U.S. dollar less relevant."" The trade of the century is still available. The next few hedge fund managers who take 100mil or greater #Bitcoin position, will become the best investors of their generation. Similar to George Soros when he broke the pound. Bitcoin has 30x from here; that's 100mil into 3 billion This #Bitcoin bull run is different. Itâs being driven by highly sophisticated investors like Paul Tudor Jones and Stan Druckenmiller, as well as publicly traded companies like MicroStrategy $MSTR and Square $SQ investing their treasury. Soon it will be driven by Central Banks. #Bitcoin is up 175% YTD and will be the best performing asset of the decade. Read all about it! #Bitcoin is the key to your financial sovereignty and wealth creation and preservation That fact that we donât know who Satoshi is yet #Bitcoinâs market cap is $330 billion, is a testament to the fact that Bitcoin speaks for itself #Bitcoin is within $500 of its all-time-high of 19,800 set 3yrs ago in December 2017. Letâs do this! #Bitcoin is still 4% below its all-time high of $19,800 set 3 years ago in December 2017. This bull run hasn't even started yet. #Bitcoin is now larger than the world's biggest banks A lot of people spend time contemplating the risks surrounding #Bitcoin. They completely miss the biggest risk of all, which is to sit on the sidelines and passively watch the greatest money and technological revolution of the century unfold before their eyes. Your dollars are to the fax machine as #Bitcoin is to email Money stored in a bank will get run over. Money invested in assets like real estate or the stock market will keep pace. Money stored in gold or #Bitcoin will outrun the scourge of inflation. And money stored in bitcoin will run the fastest, overtaking gold. #Bitcoin is getting ready to moon   CitiBank report calls #Bitcoin digital gold of the 21st century. Says devaluation of the US dollar formed the basis of the report and the comparison of bitcoin to the gold. Watch US Senator Cynthia Lummis extol the virtues of #Bitcoin as a store of value! Cash is owning a piece of the past, #Bitcoin is owning a piece of the future HODL be thy name.   Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth, as it is on the moon!  Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from fiat: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory of #Bitcoin. Amen. #Bitcoin has busted through 16k. Next stop 17k, and then the moon!  The smartest people in the room believe in #Bitcoin The smartest people in the room own #Bitcoin The #Bitcoin vaccine is 100% effective against inflation This is code for buy #Bitcoin #Bitcoin has already doubled this year. It closed 2019 at 7k, now itâs on its way to 15k and weâre just getting started #Bitcoin will be the big winner tonight #Bitcoin roaring, but it's still 5K below it's all-time-high 3yrs ago. Party is just getting started  I do think we will see an all-time-high price for #Bitcoin before 2020 is over. Even though the price has climbed from 10k to almost 14k in less than a month, it hasn't really gone on a breakout run yet. When we start to see 3-5k surges then the bulls will be on the run The most financially sophisticated people I know, who do not work in crypto, all have taken positions in #Bitcoin in the last 6 months. This quiet groundswell of demand is the reason bitcoin is on its way to 14k and beyond. JP Morgan analysts think #Bitcoin could triple in value and challenge gold. While I think its at least like a 45x from here, not a 3x, at least we can agree that bitcoin is going up . It's hard to understand why anyone wouldn't own BTC by now. And weâve breached 13k #Bitcoin. Here we go 14k! #Bitcoin. Slowly, then suddenly... #Bitcoin busts through 12k, 15k here we come! If there ever was a time to own #Bitcoin, that time has come. Even before COVID-19, and despite the longest bull run in U.S. economic history, the government was spending money like a drunken sailor, cutting taxes like Crazy Eddie, and printing money like a banana republic. #Bitcoin quietly consolidating within striking distance of 12k. Love it Few understand this. But, It's only a matter of time before everyone eventually does. #Bitcoin #Bitcoin looking strong. Poised for a breakout bull run into the New Year. Jeff Bezos' recalling raising money for Amazon: ""It took more than 50 meetings for me to raise $1 million from investors, and over the course of all those meetings, the most common question was, âWhatâs the internet?â  Sums up my early experiences telling people about #Bitcoin Email kicked off an information revolution. #Bitcoin and crypto are ushering in a money revolution. Donât leave yourself behind. Breaking: White House is proposing a new $1.8 trillion dollar advertisement campaign for #Bitcoin. To the moon! First, it was @michael_saylor and publicly traded  @MicroStrategy  buying $425million of #Bitcoin. Today, it is  @jack  and  @square  buying $50million of bitcoin. Tomorrow, it will be another visionary leader, and another, and another...the tsunami is coming #Bitcoin is all about the Long Game I've never been more bullish on #Bitcoin and ether Wow, the Bank of England discussing negative interest rates. If they adopt this, they would be paying you to borrow. You couldnât buy a better advertisement for #Bitcoin but u can take their money and go long bitcoin  The European Central Bankâs refinancing rate is 0% and its deposit rate is -.5%. This means it is free to borrow money, but actually costs you money to save.  This is both a potent recipe for inflation and powerful advertisement for #Bitcoin If you donât own #bitcoin right now, your position is long USD shitcoin and short bitcoin. Think about that for a moment. Software is eating the world and gold is on the menu. #Bitcoin At some point people will wake up and realize that bitcoin is the best safe haven asset the world has ever seen. Until then, opportunity abounds. Crypto used to be where you ended up when you couldnât make it on Wall Street. The quality of Goldman Sachsâ recent research on #Bitcoin demonstrates that there has been a talent flippening. Today, Wall Street is where you end up when you canât make it in crypto. Goldman Sachs aka Bankers aka Wall Street still don't get (or want to get) #Bitcoin. It's ok, because everyone else does. This may cause some governments to rethink their gold strategy. #Bitcoin The Internet has made it possible for you to become your own broadcaster and media empire (e.g.,  @joerogan ). Bitcoin allows you to become your own bank. I love the freedom and independence that technology can bring to the world. Bitcoin is not magic, funny money. That's the U.S. dollar and the Fed cc  @jk_rowling . The Bitcoin Halving was momentous, I'm still soaking it all in. It's incredible to think of just how much a crazy band of believers accomplished in the last 4 years. The most exciting part? We're just beginning... One of the smartest and most successful investors of the last quarter century is now long Bitcoin. Wall Street is coming...  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-tudor-jones-buys-bitcoin-165520128.htmlâ¦ The Fed has set the stage for the rise of bitcoin; the pandemic has set the stage for the rise of Big Brother.  For something that has ""died"" so many times, bitcoin sure is stayin' alive. Bitcoin is not a hedge to pandemics, it is a hedge to fiat regimes. A sudden, negative demand shock in the global economyâ will affect every asset, including gold, in the short term. Bitcoin was born in 2008, during the winter of our financial discontent. It has already weathered much to be here, and it seems unlikely to give up anytime soon. It will emerge from this current calamity stronger than ever. Decades are not measured in days. The Fed, under the leadership of Jerome Powell, continues to be #Bitcoin's biggest booster. On Thursday, he will deliver a speech about how the Fed will begin targeting higher inflation.  I am COVID negative. The only thing I have is the #Bitcoin and crypto virus which I gave to  @stoolpresidente . Itâs overwhelming at first, but once you start stacking sats, you will have long term immunity to all of the insanity in the world. I always get excited when #Bitcoin hovers around a price level for a while. Like a caged animal, it's getting more and more ready to break out. Attention #Bitcoin newcomers, you don't have to buy a full bitcoin, you can buy any fraction of a bitcoin that you want â even as little as 0.00000001 (called a ""satoshi"") is possible. This is what Bitcoiners mean when they say they're ""stacking satoshis"" or ""stacking sats."" #Bitcoin rocketing through 12K on Monday morning is much more energizing and a large cold brew. #DDTG aka  @stoolpresidente  is diving headfirst into #Bitcoin  #Bitcoin is the only long-term hedge to all the inflation that's coming... People ask me all the time if it's too late to buy #Bitcoin. I tell them that it's the bottom of the first inning and that one day they'll look back and understand just how early it is. #Bitcoin is the greatest social network of all time. #Bitcoin is gold with wings. And #Bitcoin has breached 12k. Great way to start the week! Now Goldman Sachs is into #Bitcoin. What an about face from their ""Don't Buy Bitcoin"" Report issued 3 months ago in May. Nice head fake vampire squid. Tomorrow, they will be changing their name to ""Goldman Stacking Sats.""  https://msn.com/en-us/money/markets/goldman-names-new-head-of-digital-assets-in-bet-that-blockchain-is-the-future-of-financial-markets/ar-BB17Eq0hâ¦ There are times on the #Bitcoin journey that can be lonely. Your friends think youâre crazy, people ridicule you. But weâre entering a time period when again Bitcoiners will be considered the smartest people in the room. #Bitcoin is the most inclusive investment and financial asset that world has ever seen. Bitcoin is mooning Bitcoin will set you free When money printer go brrrr and inflate the stonks market, itâs time to bitcoin. Bitcoin is trending. Earlier today, Twitter accounts were hijacked in an attempt to trick individuals into sending bitcoin to addresses owned by the attackers.  @Gemini  immediately added these addresses to our blocklist to prevent our customers from inadvertently falling victim to this scam. Bitcoin marks the beginning of the end for surveillance capitalism. This is why bitcoin is gold 2.0. Itâs mathematically impossible to counterfeit. Bitcoin requires no guns, government money does. Which do you think is stronger? Bitcoin is the first time in the history of the world that people have reached peaceful agreement around billions of dollars in economic value. The price of ether $ETH right now is $735. This is 51% off of its all-time-high, which is like buying #Bitcoin at 14k. What a steal. Iâm going to break 300k followers by the New Year and #Bitcoin is going to break 30k. Letâs get this party started  The #Bitcoin price has appreciated 300% this year #Bitcoinâs market cap is 500 billion. Goldâs market cap is 9 trillion.

Satoshi wanted to signal to everyone that Bitcoin wasnât a scam:  - No premine - 2 months heads up before launching the network - Coins had no value for 1.5 years so circulated freely (not replicable) - Unlike every other founder in history, Satoshi never cashed out 12 years since Wall Street crashed our economy:  -The 5 biggest banks have made $600B -Execs at the 5 biggest banks have been paid $4B  Meanwhile:  -Not one bank exec has gone to jail for it -The bottom 90% are still poorer than they were in 2007  That's why we have Bitcoin. $7 trillion is on the US Fed balance sheet.   $3 trillion was printed this year alone.   $1 trillion in the last 30 days.   ---   There's only one way out of this.

Bitcoin is creating a new class of high net worth individuals who will reshape the world via entrepreneurship, investment, and philanthropy. The next great Bitcoin battle will be over privacy; the cracks are already starting to show as more companies are closing accounts of people who use privacy preserving services. These companies shall find themselves on the wrong side of history. Bitcoin price predictions are ridiculous and are a disservice to the ecosystem due to their shallowness. They bait people into investing in a risky asset they don't understand well because they think it's an easy way to get rich quickly. In Bitcoin, ignorance is the path to rekt. Bitcoin HODL levels: -1) You have no bitcoin 0) Someone else has custody of your keys 1) You keep your keys in hot wallets 2) Your keys are offline 3) Your coins are protected by multiple signatures 4) Your keys are geographically separated 5) Your keys are in fortified Citadels 10 years ago Laszlo Hanyecz had tens of thousands of bitcoin he had mined just burning a hole in his pocket.

A: Perspective: the United States just announced the creation of nearly 50 Bitcoins worth of dollars out of thin air. Not 50 BTC, but 50 Bitcoin networks. Every time Bitcoin ""dies"" If your financial advisor hasn't recommended a small allocation of your portfolio to bitcoin by now, it's time to fire them and hire someone who isn't asleep at the wheel. 10 years ago a bug was exploited to create 184 billion BTC. Due to the ability to easily audit the supply it was noticed quickly; bug was patched in 5 hours.  Several protocols have since suffered inflation bugs that went unnoticed for months.  Independent auditability has value. You know what the real news is from this incident?  Someone appears to have root level access to Twitter. They OWN this platform. They are in GOD MODE. They can do ANYTHING they want on it.  And their top choice is to trick you into parting with your precious bitcoin. Bitcoin has been trading in a range of Â±3% for 6 consecutive weeks.  Bitcoin is the Linux of money. Skeptics will keep jeering about the ""year of retail Bitcoin adoption"" while the underpinnings of the entire financial system get swapped out from beneath their feet. BITCOIN BLOCK HEIGHT HITS ALL TIME HIGH! You can cancel my Twitter account. You can cancel my YouTube account. You'll never cancel my Bitcoin account. Bitcoin doesn't allow you to spend more money than you have and then charge you even more money for not having enough money.

Roses are red, Bitcoin is gold, all you need do is keep calm and hold. Bitcoin is creating a new class of high net worth individuals who will reshape the world via entrepreneurship, investment, and philanthropy. The next great Bitcoin battle will be over privacy; the cracks are already starting to show as more companies are closing accounts of people who use privacy preserving services. These companies shall find themselves on the wrong side of history. Bitcoin price predictions are ridiculous and are a disservice to the ecosystem due to their shallowness. They bait people into investing in a risky asset they don't understand well because they think it's an easy way to get rich quickly. In Bitcoin, ignorance is the path to rekt. Bitcoin HODL levels: -1) You have no bitcoin 0) Someone else has custody of your keys 1) You keep your keys in hot wallets 2) Your keys are offline 3) Your coins are protected by multiple signatures 4) Your keys are geographically separated 5) Your keys are in fortified Citadels 10 years ago Laszlo Hanyecz had tens of thousands of bitcoin he had mined just burning a hole in his pocket.

A: Perspective: the United States just announced the creation of nearly 50 Bitcoins worth of dollars out of thin air. Not 50 BTC, but 50 Bitcoin networks. Every time Bitcoin ""dies"" If your financial advisor hasn't recommended a small allocation of your portfolio to bitcoin by now, it's time to fire them and hire someone who isn't asleep at the wheel. 10 years ago a bug was exploited to create 184 billion BTC. Due to the ability to easily audit the supply it was noticed quickly; bug was patched in 5 hours.  Several protocols have since suffered inflation bugs that went unnoticed for months.  Independent auditability has value. You know what the real news is from this incident?  Someone appears to have root level access to Twitter. They OWN this platform. They are in GOD MODE. They can do ANYTHING they want on it.  And their top choice is to trick you into parting with your precious bitcoin. Bitcoin has been trading in a range of Â±3% for 6 consecutive weeks.  Bitcoin is the Linux of money. Skeptics will keep jeering about the ""year of retail Bitcoin adoption"" while the underpinnings of the entire financial system get swapped out from beneath their feet. BITCOIN BLOCK HEIGHT HITS ALL TIME HIGH! You can cancel my Twitter account. You can cancel my YouTube account. You'll never cancel my Bitcoin account.

(Plotted in log charts so % gains/losses are proportional within each respective sparkline) Seeking the decoupling...  Here's where we are in the timeline compared to the 2008 banking crisis.   Decoupling of safe havens from equities showing hints it may have begun (i.e. when BTC and Gold go bullish). We'll have more confirmation in a week. The next key event is confirmation of BTC decoupling from traditional markets. Here's a bunch of charts, many are bullish. I will note that I don't expect a V-shaped bottom, I think there will be time, an accumulation range before moving up. Dump then moon. We are undergoing flight to safety right now, BTC is looking for its bottom. But know that once the bottom is in there are strong bullish pressures ahead. It's this economic environment in the years ahead that Bitcoin was built for. The Bitcoin 4 year bull/bear cycle is caused by sell pressure reduction every 4 years by the BTC halvening. That impulse creates a resonance, like a slosh of water in a bath tub when you push it timed just right. The magic happens at the impulse. #Bitcoin has had 12yrs of capital inflows with minimal outflows, and a decade long span of doubling users every yr.  Today ~2% of the world population has exposure.  Next year people cease to think of it as a Tulips bubble. It won't ever be this cheap again. The growth in capital flowing into BTC is now equivalent to Apr 2017 of last cycle. The early bull phase is over, the main phase has started; it's come early.  Realised cap estimates the capital invested into #Bitcoin. Its slope = the rate of capital influx (as % of its cap). Gold supply doubles every 40 years.  It's a flawed version of #Bitcoin, but I guess it was the best SoV tech we had in the Agrarian Age. One dollar invested in Bitcoin at its first market price would be worth $29.8m today. That dollar invested in Gold would be worth a snickers bar.  In this chart I've wound back the clock to include Gold's last really big run in the 1970s (when the structure of money was reset). Zoomed view.  $100k is a ridiculously low target at the current trajectory.  $55k is the next landmark -> Bitcoin becomes a $1T macro asset bucket.  We are not at the all-time-high juncture where the BTC Top Cap Model starts curving upwards.  Let's see how high she runs in 2021.  Congrats #Bitcoin! In 4 years, 2024, easily a quarter of the world will have exposure to BTC given its growth trajectory.   I find it ironic that Bitcoin ""maximalists"" find this hard to believe, they've seen <1% penetration for the first 11 years. Exponential growth has  surprising outcomes. The adoption curve of Bitcoin is faster than any other global infrastructure rollout before it.  It's growing faster than the rollout of the Internet, mobile phones, and easily faster than ""virtual banking"" players like PayPal. TV was originally radio shows with pictures, sitcoms came 20yrs later.  Early websites were e-zines, social media came 20yrs later.  Bitcoin currently mimics industrial age finance, we do not know yet how it will eventually express itself but it will define this age. It's important to understand BTC behaves like a startup, powered by an adoption curve.   Traditional investors will compare it gold or label it ""uncorrelated"" or maybe even ""decoupled"". Well yeah, that happens, startups will rip your face off and take over the world. While we wait for BTC post an all-time-high, both on the monthly chart of $14k and the 20k prior top. I'll point out that the organic valuation under NVT Price from underlying long term investors is already at an all-time-high. Price will follow. User base: PayPal 346m+ Bitcoin 187m+  This is a big deal.  Estimating how many HODLers of BTC from on-chain forensics is from the incredible work of  @glassnode . Bitcoin is not an approximation to Gold, in fact Gold is an approximation to Bitcoin.  Gold gets its store of value based on historical scarcity (but only due to technological limitation) while Bitcoin is a mathematical game-theoretic implementation of a perfect scarcity. Square's buy of 4,709 BTC and Microstrategy's 38,250 BTC is the tip of the iceberg. The last 8 months has seen a reduction of 250,000 BTC in the speculative stockpile sitting on exchanges signalling many other *unannounced* investors have been scooping coins off the market. The real news is that Bitcoin is so liquid that it can swallow Square's $50m buy without any sizeable impact on price. The same can be said about MicroStrategy's $425m buy.  Bitcoin's liquidity is already sufficient for the herd that's coming. A good time to retweet this, only 20 days later, Square drops its first $50m into BTC. Nice call by @michael_saylor Gold's having its best year since 2010. This how it's doing against BTC.   $1 invested on 6 Oct 2009 (when BTC was first priced) would be worth $13.9m today.  Bitcoin's software is quietly eating the financial world. Prepare for a great Q4 2020 for BTC folks (blah blah, de-coupling, blah blah, new correlations).

The price of #Bitcoin increased 0.60% from the end of February to the end of April amidst one of the most catastrophic economic events in history.  A store of value. You canât fully understand how antifragile #Bitcoin is until you see it go through a period like this- juxtaposed against such obviously rickety financial markets.  Pay attention. Youâve never seen anything like this before. Never been anything like this before. I don't know how long this will last, but-  After the dust settles. After economic activity resumes. After CBs & govts inject *many trillions* of new dollars by increasing bal sheets & deficits.  Off that bottom, there is no other asset on the planet that will move like #Bitcoin A lot of folks have been asking why BTC isnât higher right now.  If you own #Bitcoin, just be patient.  BTC has historically transferred wealth from impatient hands to patient. Just be patient.  Central banks are doing all the leg work for you as we speak. Just be patient. I call this chart ""The Traditional Onslaught"".  We've been talking about ""The Herd"" for 3+ years. The Herd requires career risk cover. This is that.  They are by definition not early adopters, but their pockets are deep & their capital is sticky. #Bitcoin is just getting started. For the record, the last time we had a presidential debate, the price of #Bitcoin was $617. 5 years of trendlines perfecting coinciding with the most highly anticipated event in BTC history.

PeterSchiff,"I just lost all the #Bitcoin I have ever owned. My wallet got corrupted somehow and my password is no longer valid. So now not only is my Bitcoin intrinsically worthless; it has no market value either. I knew owning Bitcoin was a bad idea, I just never realized it was this bad! Happy #Bitcoin Halving to all my HODLer friends. But now that the halving has come and gone, what happens next? I have a question for Bitcoin HODLers. If a global pandemic, crashing stock markets, world-wide recession/depression, zero percent interest rates, unprecedented government borrowing and fiat money printing, plus a breakout in #gold hasnât caused #Bitcoin to go up, what will? As #Bitcoin crashes below $6K, down almost 20% this year, hodlers can take comfort in Bitcoin not being the worst performing asset of the decade. For now, that distinction belongs to oil, which is down by 50%. But at the rate Bitcoin is falling this comfort may not last long. Gold is not valuable because it's scarce. Gold's value comes from all of the unique properties that it has as a metal. Utility makes #gold valuable. Scarcity just makes it expensive. #Bitcoin has no unique properties. Scarcity without utility is meaningless. How long do you think it will take before the price of an ounce of #gold is higher than the price of one #Bitcoin? It seems like  @elonmusk  was only joking about exposing Tesla shareholders to Bitcoin. So I don't need to convince the board not to turn Tesla into a double bubble. But I'm still willing to debate @michael_saylor on #Bitcoin verse #gold.  Perhaps  @joerogan  is willing to moderate. Against my advice my son  @SchiffSpencer  just bought even more #Bitcoin. Whose advice do you want to follow? A 57-year-old experienced investor/business owner who's been an investment professional for over 30 years or an 18-year-old college freshman who's never even had a job.

Wall Street wants Bitcoin, and they don't care what Goldman Sachs has to say. In the last two weeks...  - Grayscale added 14,422 BTC to $GBTC.  - Microstrategy bought 21,454 BTC.  - Bitcoin miners mined 12,594 BTC. Unbelievable!  Square did $875 million of Bitcoin revenue during Q2 2020.  That's almost 3x the volume of Q1 2020, and 25x more than Q1 2018 when Bitcoin buying went live on the Cash App. Bitcoin is having a huge year in Africa.  P2P volumes keep hitting ATHs (up 2.5x since March), and Nigeria's Naira just broke $10 million USD of volume last week.  That's more than any other fiat currency (except USD), and twice as much volume as the Venezuelan bolivar.  Wake up. Bitcoin adoption in Africa is setting all-time highs every week now.  In just 3 months, P2P volumes are up:  125% in Nigeria 199% in Kenya 194% in South Africa 257% in Ghana  Combined, these four currencies are now exchanging over $15M USD/week of Bitcoin. Unbelievable.  Grayscale added 19,879 BTC to their Bitcoin Trust since last week (53,588 BTC since the halving).  Bitcoin miners only produced 7,081 BTC since last week (39,544 BTC since halving).  That's almost 400,000 BTC under management for $GBTC Boom!  VanEck, a $49 billion investment firm, just filed an SEC registration for their upcoming VanEck Bitcoin Trust. Bad news for Bitcoin bears.  Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust just added 12,319 BTC to $GBTC in a single day.  That's more than the 11,512 BTC they added during all of last week, when Bitcoin broke its ATH.

Soon many other companies will follow, and eventually central banks. This is just the beginning... #Bitcoin has been hovering around $10k for perhaps the longest stretch since inception.

Same conference where  @davidein  presented a short case for Lehman in 2007. Lehman filed for bankruptcy less than a year later. When #Bitcoin takes over Hong Kong. #Bitcoin and Ether are emergent money. They havenât been forced upon anyone, their adoption is peaceful and organic. Fiat money is violent money, its adoption always requires force. The total amount of above-ground gold on earth fits into an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Physical assets are easier to control, seize, and censor. #Bitcoin lives everywhere and nowhere, its digital nature is one of its greatest strengths. #Bitcoin has made significant ground on gold â going from white paper to over $200 billion in market capitalization in under a decade. It will continue to cannibalize gold dramatically over the next decade. I don't normally like making definitive #bitcoin price predictions. That being said, this is the last time you're going to see bitcoin below $12K...until it goes back above $12K.

Soon many other companies will follow, and eventually central banks. This is just the beginning... #Bitcoin has been hovering around $10k for perhaps the longest stretch since inception. It's been pretty boring. That's a good thing. On this day in 2013, @tylerwinklevoss and I presented the long case for #Bitcoin at the Value Investing Congress in NYC. The price of bitcoin was $132.  Same conference where  @davidein  presented a short case for Lehman in 2007. Lehman filed for bankruptcy less than a year later. When #Bitcoin takes over Hong Kong. #Bitcoin and Ether are emergent money. They havenât been forced upon anyone, their adoption is peaceful and organic. Fiat money is violent money, its adoption always requires force. The total amount of above-ground gold on earth fits into an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Physical assets are easier to control, seize, and censor. #Bitcoin lives everywhere and nowhere, its digital nature is one of its greatest strengths. #Bitcoin has made significant ground on gold â going from white paper to over $200 billion in market capitalization in under a decade. It will continue to cannibalize gold dramatically over the next decade. I don't normally like making definitive #bitcoin price predictions. That being said, this is the last time you're going to see bitcoin below $12K...until it goes back above $12K. ",ENFP,0.0616

BitcoinIsSaving,"If itâs not Bitcoin, itâs not your money. This marks the beginning of the end for fiat, and the end of the beginning for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is going mainstream because it is reinventing savings: can now hold your own digital cash without credit or dilution risk. If you own 10 bitcoin you are literally a billionaire.  Few understand this. Austrian economists were right, holding cash is rational and makes for a resilient economy.   Keynesian economists were wrong, using inflation to penalize holding cash just benefits politicians and makes for a fragile economy.  #Bitcoin lets people opt out of Keynesian madness. Bitcoin is the only free market in the world. Bitcoin doesnât have a âlimit downâ or âcircuit breakersâ because it is a real market with a real clearing price.  Stocks and bonds are not real markets, they are Potemkin villages, their prices are highly manipulated and political. Bitcoin has proven itself to be easier to liquidate than:  â¢ stocks â¢ bonds â¢ real estate â¢ gold  All thanks to 24/7 final settlement and 24/7 exchange trading.  The smart money is learning this. Bitcoin proved that it is the ultimate safe-haven asset yesterday. Even in a crisis, the network stays up, the exchanges trade 24/7, and the market found a healthy clearing price - well above the 2015 low. Very impressive! Bitcoin is easier to understand than fiat. Buy 0.01 btc at least.  That is 1,000,000 satoshis (sats).  Hold it, you might need it later to buy food for your family. Bitcoin will stop wars. Thereâs a bitcoin shortage. Governments should send everyone 1 bitcoin to stimulate the economy. Bitcoin is saving, not investing. Young people: focus on working to accumulate bitcoin.   High school and college can wait. 10 bitcoin to be a billionaire. Bitcoin is the only major currency that has increased in value over the past 10 years.  All of the other ones lost value.  Fact. Governments that accumulate #bitcoin will be able to drop taxes to zero and just perpetually operate off of gains. Buying and holding #bitcoin is tax-exempt because Bitcoin is a religion.   Selling #bitcoin is taxable because it is a sin. Bitcoin is backed by science.  Fiat is backed by politics. If itâs not Bitcoin, itâs not your money. This marks the beginning of the end for fiat, and the end of the beginning for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is going mainstream because it is reinventing savings: can now hold your own digital cash without credit or dilution risk. If you own 10 bitcoin you are literally a billionaire.  Few understand this. Austrian economists were right, holding cash is rational and makes for a resilient economy.   Keynesian economists were wrong, using inflation to penalize holding cash just benefits politicians and makes for a fragile economy.  #Bitcoin lets people opt out of Keynesian madness.

Wall Street wants Bitcoin, and they don't care what Goldman Sachs has to say. In the last two weeks...  - Grayscale added 14,422 BTC to $GBTC.  - Microstrategy bought 21,454 BTC.  - Bitcoin miners mined 12,594 BTC. Unbelievable!  Square did $875 million of Bitcoin revenue during Q2 2020.  That's almost 3x the volume of Q1 2020, and 25x more than Q1 2018 when Bitcoin buying went live on the Cash App. Bitcoin is having a huge year in Africa.  P2P volumes keep hitting ATHs (up 2.5x since March), and Nigeria's Naira just broke $10 million USD of volume last week.  That's more than any other fiat currency (except USD), and twice as much volume as the Venezuelan bolivar.  Wake up. Bitcoin adoption in Africa is setting all-time highs every week now.  In just 3 months, P2P volumes are up:  125% in Nigeria 199% in Kenya 194% in South Africa 257% in Ghana  Combined, these four currencies are now exchanging over $15M USD/week of Bitcoin. Unbelievable.  Grayscale added 19,879 BTC to their Bitcoin Trust since last week (53,588 BTC since the halving).  Bitcoin miners only produced 7,081 BTC since last week (39,544 BTC since halving).  That's almost 400,000 BTC under management for $GBTC Boom!  VanEck, a $49 billion investment firm, just filed an SEC registration for their upcoming VanEck Bitcoin Trust. Bad news for Bitcoin bears.  Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust just added 12,319 BTC to $GBTC in a single day.  That's more than the 11,512 BTC they added during all of last week, when Bitcoin broke its ATH. MicroStrategy now has 70,470 BTC.  The US Government has 69,420 BTC. 3 Bitcoin funds bought up 24,337 BTC this week.  There are only 21 million, and they're going fast.

TheCryptoLark,"#bitcoin is inevitable, all who have gone against it are now being forced to kneel, first JPMorgan, now Goldman Sachs. Banks made 10 Billion off of being the middleman for the Federal loan program for small businesses. The banks assumed no risk, had to do almost no work, and the tax payers foot the bill. Disgusting.  #bitcoin #crypto #bitcoin went from 12k to 20k within the space of a few days in 2017 with fewer fiat on ramps, 1/10 of the stablecoin cap, and tiny handful of working #crypto products. The 2020/2021 bull market will be INSANE In the last bull run #bitcoin had multiple pullbacks of 30-40% to test the 200 day moving average. Selling your $btc now on a 13% pullback is like selling on the red circle on this chart. Insane gains are coming, don't get shaken out. There is not enough #bitcoin for each paypal user to have 0.05 $btc - let that sink in No one knows when, but gravity will catch up with #bitcoin and alts will go insane Paypal and Cashapp combined are buying more than all the newly produced #bitcoin. Grayscale is buying more than both of them combined.   What does that mean? Moon The world's second biggest bank is selling 3 billion dollars worth of bonds in exchange for #bitcoin!!! Unreal man.... Square sold two times more #bitcoin than was produced in Q3! Add in Grayscale and now Paypal and there is a serious supply crisis coming. Moon soon. Grayscale bought 16,000 #bitcoin last week.  Miners created 6,300.   Grayscale bought 2.5X more $btc than was produced!  INSANE SCARCITY coming into effect!  Moooonnnnnnn!!!! People already buying #bitcoin on Paypal! 346 million customers. Good night bears, see you next time. Over a billion worth of #bitcoin moved for $3! Moving that much gold would require armed guards and a chartered jet and take days! Classic #crypto day with people panic selling alts for massive losses to fomo into a 2% #bitcoin move Remember 2 days ago when JP Morgan was caught rigging #gold markets for 8 years and their CEO didn't go to jail? Yeah, but let's throw the book at Bitmex because something something #bitcoin Grayscale just bought another 17,100 MORE #bitcoin! They now own 2.5% of the entire supply! They will soon enough own 5% then 10%. Stack those sats friends, get yours before Grayscale does! #bitcoin has now closed above $10,000 for 63 days in a row, the longest run its history. Any dips under 10k were aggressively bought. Halving effects starting to be felt.    This 37% drop happened to #bitcoin back in January 2017, weak hands capitulated.

jimmysong,"Imagine how hopeless everything would seem right now without #Bitcoin. 5 Regrets you will always have in #Bitcoin:  * Not learning about it sooner * Not buying more of it when it was cheaper * Selling it * Spending it when another method of payment was an option * Trading it to invest in altcoins If you own #Bitcoin, your best days are ahead of you. Don't tell friends how much #Bitcoin you have. Other than the obvious reason that it protects your privacy, you're protecting the other person. Envy is real and ruins a lot of relationships.

Instead, such actions become ""monetary policy"" or ""adding liquidity to the system"" to deceive us.  #Bitcoin is the monetary red pill. $6 Trillion:  * USD M2 money supply in 2004 * GDP of the US in 1990 * Down payment to buy all the real estate in the US * Enough to buy 68.9% of all the gold in the world at spot * 1.6 years of tax revenue for the US  Seriously, why are we paying taxes again?  #Bitcoin fixes this In 2020, #Bitcoin will have expand by less than 2.5%  Fed has already printed $700B for open market operations (4.5%), $500B for overnight repo (3.2%) and will have to print an additional $1T+ (6.5%) for the fiscal stimulus. That's an expansion of 14.2% total and it's just March. The question I hope everyone will soon ask:  If the government can just print money, why do we pay taxes at all?  Going down that rabbit hole will eventually lead them to #Bitcoin The more you understand #Bitcoin and what sound money truly is, the less you care about money and the more you care about your time. Still think ""store of value"" is not ""using"" #Bitcoin? Look at  @MicroStrategy : they're using #BTC as a reserve asset, not to pay for coffee.  Every CFO will be studying what they did in 24 months. Every business school will be studying this in 5 years.  Make savings popular again If you can inflate the money supply, you increase the costs of everything else. Higher costs mean you're devaluing labor. If you can devalue someone's labor at will, you've essentially enslaved them.  This 4th of July, rebel against monetary slavery with #Bitcoin I just published Bitcoin: A Declaration of Monetary Independence PayPal is going allow people to buy #Bitcoin.  Paypal is the company that froze the Wikileaks account and put #Bitcoin on the map back in 2010.   It only took a decade for this to come full circle. If 2020 has taught us anything, it's that government has way too much power in all aspects. They control the communication mediums, the money supply, the military and the police.  We can start taking some of that power back with #Bitcoin. It takes time and effort to learn #Bitcoin, just like anything worthwhile.  If you're too busy, arrogant or lazy to learn, that's your loss, literally. Money is the one topic you can't afford to be ignorant about.  Start down that rabbit hole and you'll end at #Bitcoin.

BitcoinIsSaving,"If itâs not Bitcoin, itâs not your money. This marks the beginning of the end for fiat, and the end of the beginning for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is going mainstream because it is reinventing savings: can now hold your own digital cash without credit or dilution risk. If you own 10 bitcoin you are literally a billionaire.  Few understand this. Austrian economists were right, holding cash is rational and makes for a resilient economy.   Keynesian economists were wrong, using inflation to penalize holding cash just benefits politicians and makes for a fragile economy.  #Bitcoin lets people opt out of Keynesian madness. Bitcoin is the only free market in the world. Bitcoin doesnât have a âlimit downâ or âcircuit breakersâ because it is a real market with a real clearing price.  Stocks and bonds are not real markets, they are Potemkin villages, their prices are highly manipulated and political. Bitcoin has proven itself to be easier to liquidate than:  â¢ stocks â¢ bonds â¢ real estate â¢ gold  All thanks to 24/7 final settlement and 24/7 exchange trading.  The smart money is learning this. Bitcoin proved that it is the ultimate safe-haven asset yesterday. Even in a crisis, the network stays up, the exchanges trade 24/7, and the market found a healthy clearing price - well above the 2015 low. Very impressive! Bitcoin is easier to understand than fiat. Buy 0.01 btc at least.  That is 1,000,000 satoshis (sats).  Hold it, you might need it later to buy food for your family. Bitcoin will stop wars. Thereâs a bitcoin shortage. Governments should send everyone 1 bitcoin to stimulate the economy. Bitcoin is saving, not investing. Young people: focus on working to accumulate bitcoin.   High school and college can wait. 10 bitcoin to be a billionaire. Bitcoin is the only major currency that has increased in value over the past 10 years.  All of the other ones lost value.  Fact. Governments that accumulate #bitcoin will be able to drop taxes to zero and just perpetually operate off of gains. Buying and holding #bitcoin is tax-exempt because Bitcoin is a religion.   Selling #bitcoin is taxable because it is a sin. Bitcoin is backed by science.  Fiat is backed by politics. If itâs not Bitcoin, itâs not your money.

Governments that accumulate #bitcoin will be able to drop taxes to zero and just perpetually operate off of gains. Buying and holding #bitcoin is tax-exempt because Bitcoin is a religion.   Selling #bitcoin is taxable because it is a sin. Bitcoin is backed by science.  Fiat is backed by politics. ",INTJ,0.0292

real_vijay,"1/ On the eve of #Bitcoin's quadrennial supply shock, inquiring minds are wondering whether the so-called ""Bitcoin halving"" is ""priced in"". In this thread I will explain that it is not and it cannot be priced in.  The big blocks of #Bitcoin that are being sold now are falling into the hands of people with deep conviction. They will form a bedrock on which the next rally will be built. If you got into #Bitcoin because you understood its superiority as a monetary asset, you are early - very early.   The late majority who get exposure to Bitcoin will not do so because they understand it but out of pure economic necessity. 1/ In their embryonic form many species appear alike. But imprinted in their various DNAs is the code that will evince their great differences in the fullness of time.   A thread on the great debate about what #Bitcoin is and why only one of the two major visions makes sense Never in the history of the world had it been possible to transfer value between distant peoples without relying on a trusted intermediary, such as a bank or government.   #Bitcoin solved one of the most important problems of social coordination since the dawn of civilization. It took 8 years for #Bitcoin to move from zero to $2000.  It moved $2000 in less than an hour today. Broke: #Bitcoin is too risky.  Woke: MassMutual an insurance company whose only job has been to manage risk for 170 years bought $100m worth of Bitcoin.  Bespoke: 50 years from now *selling* bitcoins will be considered risky. Citi downgraded MicroStrategy because of its plan to accumulate a significant amount of #Bitcoin in its corporate treasury.

MalwareTechBlog,"âWhen the stock markets crash, bitcoin wiââ âOh...oh no.â Apparently the Twitter hackers could have made around $400,000 if it wasn't for the fact Coinbase swiftly blocked their users from sending bitcoin to the attacker's wallet. A bunch of high profile cryptocurrency Twitter accounts have been hijacked to tweet bitcoin scams. Likely a 3rd party App compromise rather that Twitter itself. Wallet has received ~$6000. First post i clicked on today was about the price of gold and the top comment was ""bitcoin is backed by electricity, gold isn't backed by anything"".

If that's not intrinsically valuable, what is? NYDIG parent Stone Ridge holds 10,000+ BTC in its own treasury while managing $10+ billion in other assets for some of the largest corporations, banks & insurers in the world. Firms that sell #Bitcoin should hold #Bitcoin.   #Skininthegame As the trillions of dollars on the balance sheets of banks, asset managers, insurance firms, endowments, & family offices begin their migration to the #Bitcoin universe, they will need firms like NYDIG to guide them.  $1 billion down, more to go. For any company or investor considering #Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset,  @MicroStrategy  has published a curated set of resources including some of the reference materials we relied upon to make our decision. #Bitcoin makes a fine treasury reserve asset.   My admiration goes out to  @jack  and the  @Square  team for leading the way. For 953 million people in 20 countries with weakening currencies, #Bitcoin represents something greater than a treasury asset.  For them, it's more like an ark of encrypted energy to escape the flood. I considered investing our treasury in fiat, bonds, stocks, swaps, index funds, options, real estate, commodities, precious metals, art, & intangibles before settling on #Bitcoin. It seems like the ideal long duration asset â I donât understand why anyone would want to trade it. 21st century investors lost trillions clinging to 20th century ideas.  #Gold peaked in the 19th century.

We discuss inflation, the limitations of physical #gold, & why #Bitcoin has advantages similar to  @Apple ,  @Google , &  @Facebook .   https://youtu.be/6RuQhsNAYh8 via  @YouTube The magic of #Bitcoin isnât the transfer of money to someone 10,000 miles away â it is the transfer of money to someone 10,000 days away. No one can buy a pizza with their stock, bonds, real estate, gold, or derivatives.  No one cares.  #Bitcoin does not need to be a medium of exchange. #Bitcoin is 19.3 trillion times more secure than it was 10 years ago, 50x more secure than the next best thing.   Gold is still as secure as it was in 1934.  https://btc.com/stats/diff There is no truth to the stories currently circulating that speculate ""he would not hesitate to dump MicroStrategyâs 38,250 Bitcoin (BTC) at a momentâs notice if an alternative assetâs yields were to jump.""   This is creative journalism. When considering network dominance in the crypto industry, I find it clarifying to separate crypto-asset networks like #Bitcoin from crypto-application networks like Ethereum & stablecoins. Bitcoin dominance has advanced from a low of 71.05% on December 20, 2017 to 93.57% today. To acquire 16,796 BTC (disclosed  9/14/20), we traded continuously 74 hours, executing 88,617 trades ~0.19 BTC each 3 seconds. ~$39,414 in BTC per minute, but at all times we were ready to purchase $30-50 million in a few seconds if we got lucky with a 1-2% downward spike. We acquired 21,454 BTC via 78,388 off-chain transactions, then secured it in cold storage with 18 on-chain transactions.  #Bitcoin scales just fine as a store of value.

Everyone understands this.  #Bitcoin is what happens when we pool monetary energy on a software network.  Few understand this. Everyone in the crypto industry would benefit if analysts segmented the market into crypto-assets (e.g. #Bitcoin), crypto-applications (e.g. Ethereum), & crypto-currencies (e.g. Tether), and calculated three different dominance metrics. #Bitcoin is an ark of encrypted energy to escape the currency flood. Tomorrow I am going to try to convince  @KeithMcCullough  to change his opinion of #Bitcoin and join the cyber hornets. #Bitcoin is like Facebook, except no one ever brought a billion friends to #Facebook. #Bitcoin investors understand that preserving energy in a world where everyone else is dissipating it is a winning strategy. The crypto analysts & exchanges should stop comparing #Bitcoin to Altcoins and start comparing Bitcoin to Fiat, Gold, Equity, & Bonds since those assets hold 99.9% of the monetary energy in the world. #Bitcoin will be the dominant monetary network because of the Maximalists.   ""If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry."" #Bitcoin is the first digital monetary system capable of storing all the money in the world for every individual, corporation, and government in a fair & equitable manner, without losing any of it.  If that's not intrinsically valuable, what is? NYDIG parent Stone Ridge holds 10,000+ BTC in its own treasury while managing $10+ billion in other assets for some of the largest corporations, banks & insurers in the world. Firms that sell #Bitcoin should hold #Bitcoin.   #Skininthegame As the trillions of dollars on the balance sheets of banks, asset managers, insurance firms, endowments, & family offices begin their migration to the #Bitcoin universe, they will need firms like NYDIG to guide them.  $1 billion down, more to go. For any company or investor considering #Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset,  @MicroStrategy  has published a curated set of resources including some of the reference materials we relied upon to make our decision. #Bitcoin makes a fine treasury reserve asset.   My admiration goes out to  @jack  and the  @Square  team for leading the way. For 953 million people in 20 countries with weakening currencies, #Bitcoin represents something greater than a treasury asset.  For them, it's more like an ark of encrypted energy to escape the flood. I considered investing our treasury in fiat, bonds, stocks, swaps, index funds, options, real estate, commodities, precious metals, art, & intangibles before settling on #Bitcoin. It seems like the ideal long duration asset â I donât understand why anyone would want to trade it. 21st century investors lost trillions clinging to 20th century ideas.  #Gold peaked in the 19th century.  Buy #Bitcoin. In this interview I explain why I believe that #Bitcoin is digital gold â the ideal treasury reserve asset.   We discuss inflation, the limitations of physical #gold, & why #Bitcoin has advantages similar to  @Apple ,  @Google , &  @Facebook . In this interview I explain why I believe that #Bitcoin is digital gold - the ideal treasury reserve asset.  We discuss inflation, the limitations of physical #gold, & why #Bitcoin has advantages similar to  @Apple ,  @Google , &  @Facebook .   https://youtu.be/6RuQhsNAYh8 via  @YouTube The magic of #Bitcoin isnât the transfer of money to someone 10,000 miles away â it is the transfer of money to someone 10,000 days away. No one can buy a pizza with their stock, bonds, real estate, gold, or derivatives.  No one cares.  #Bitcoin does not need to be a medium of exchange. #Bitcoin is 19.3 trillion times more secure than it was 10 years ago, 50x more secure than the next best thing.   Gold is still as secure as it was in 1934.  https://btc.com/stats/diff There is no truth to the stories currently circulating that speculate ""he would not hesitate to dump MicroStrategyâs 38,250 Bitcoin (BTC) at a momentâs notice if an alternative assetâs yields were to jump.""   This is creative journalism. When considering network dominance in the crypto industry, I find it clarifying to separate crypto-asset networks like #Bitcoin from crypto-application networks like Ethereum & stablecoins. Bitcoin dominance has advanced from a low of 71.05% on December 20, 2017 to 93.57% today. To acquire 16,796 BTC (disclosed  9/14/20), we traded continuously 74 hours, executing 88,617 trades ~0.19 BTC each 3 seconds. ~$39,414 in BTC per minute, but at all times we were ready to purchase $30-50 million in a few seconds if we got lucky with a 1-2% downward spike. We acquired 21,454 BTC via 78,388 off-chain transactions, then secured it in cold storage with 18 on-chain transactions.  #Bitcoin scales just fine as a store of value. ",INTP,0.0493
