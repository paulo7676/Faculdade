  @moduledoc """
  Cache behaviour & dispatcher for guilds.

  You can call the functions provided by this module independent of which cache
  is configured, and it will dispatch to the configured cache implementation.

  By default, #{@default_cache_implementation} will be used for caching guilds.
  You can override this in the `:caches` option of the `:nostrum` application
  by setting the `:guilds` field to a different module implementing the
  `Nostrum.Cache.GuildCache` behaviour. Any module below
  `Nostrum.Cache.GuildCache` can be used as a cache.

  ## Writing your own guild cache

  As with the other caches, the guild cache API consists of two parts:

  - The functions that the user calls, such as `c:all/0` or `c:select_by/2`.

  - The functions that nostrum calls, such as `c:create/1` or `c:update/1`.
  These **do not create any objects in the Discord API**, they are purely
  created to update the cached data from data that Discord sends us. If you
  want to create objects on Discord, use the functions exposed by `Nostrum.Api`
  instead.

  You need to implement both of them for nostrum to work with your custom
  cache. **You also need to implement `Supervisor` callbacks**, which will
  start your cache as a child under `Nostrum.Cache.CacheSupervisor`: As an
  example, the `Nostrum.Cache.GuildCache.ETS` implementation uses this to to
  set up its ETS table it uses for caching. See the callbacks section for every
  nostrum-related callback you need to implement.

  Note that this module also defines a few helper functions, such as `get!/1`
  or `select_by!/2`, which call the backing cache's regular functions and
  perform the result unwrapping by themselves.

  The "upstream data" wording in this module references the fact that the
  data that the guild cache (and other caches) retrieves represents the raw
  data we receive from the upstream connection, no attempt is made by nostrum
  to sanitize the data before it enters the cache. Caching implementations
  need to cast the data to the resulting type themselves. A possible future
  improvement would be moving the data casting into this module before the
  backing cache implementation is called.

  #293](https://github.com/Kraigie/nostrum/issues/293). Note that the linked
  issue refers to the old contents of this module before the ETS-based guild
  cache was moved into `#{__MODULE__}.ETS`.
